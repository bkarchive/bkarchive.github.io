Always were us who have attacked militarily .\n\nIn the bloody Crusades, during colonialism, World War I and II, we attend mass destruction under the Chinese and Soviet communism, the Holocaust as well .\n\nSo in all these events Muslims did not attend , but we were . And when i read that in Germany 83% of people , calls them fanatical Muslims , it is clear that the Western world is not at all knowledgeable about Islam and the Muslim world.\n\nWhen it comes about fanatics , they are in the west and in the and in western parliaments . I personally have not found anywhere love and hospitality better than the Islamic world''.\n\nJ\u00fcrgen Todenh\u00f6fer -Former German politician and lawyer."}
