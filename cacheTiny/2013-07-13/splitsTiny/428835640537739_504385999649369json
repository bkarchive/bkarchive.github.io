This daily also published a false report today exactly like yesterday with a view to channeling the anti-quota movement of BCS students to opposite direction. In the report, Chhatrashibir has been linked to violence and ill incitement during the movement and ill attempts have also been made in that regard by stating two students named Shahin and Mamun as Shibir men. But, Chhatrashibir is always far off from violence in any case whatsoever; nor does it believe in any type of violence. This report is vividly seen to hide the brutal and joint attack of cops and BCL men on the protesters.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cUnited student movement and effective media are some parts of golden history of this Bengal and this golden history is now thoroughly stained by the dirty role played by Chhatra League and Dainik Amader Somoi. This is really alarming for the nation as a whole.\u201d\n\nHe urged the concerned media and media man to refrain from publishing such false and fabricated reports in the days to come."}
