Abdul Jabbar said, \u201cThe month of Ramadan is to train us to fight anti-Islam evil. So, we have to be armed with the weapon of TAQWA and fight anti-Islam evil by infusing in us the very teachings of Ramadan.\u201d\n\nHe said so today while addressing as the Chief Guest to a Member-Candidate Conference held in a community centre of the capital. The Conference was attended by some other Central leaders of the Organization.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe month of Ramadan advocates peace in the society and state at large but there is no sort of peace throughout the country today. Thousands of leaders of country\u2019s Islamic Movement like Allama Saydee, Moulana Nizami, Professor Golam Azam and Shibir President Md. Delwar Hussen are now observing fasting behind bars. Jamaat-Shibir men are being persecuted even in this month of Ramadan. We demand immediate release of all the leaders and activists of Jamaat and Shibir.\u201d"}
