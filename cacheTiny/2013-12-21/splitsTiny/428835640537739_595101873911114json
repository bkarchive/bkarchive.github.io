Even though all our family members have enormous mental strength, all of us are now completely devastated.\n\nThis was not the first time that my father was taken into custody, but the enormity of suffering this time was overwhelming.\n\nThis time our usual activities were: visiting him in jail in Kashimpur in the district of Gazipur on Saturdays; trying to meet all his basic needs from outside as he had a medical condition; running here and there to continue the legal battle; carrying the stigma of our inability to do anything meaningful to protect his innocence from the wrath of tyranny, all these virtually crippled our family. Despite everything, a tender smile from my father\u2019s innocent face made everything bearable.\n\n\"No Physical Revenge\"\n\nMollah said, \u201cNo physical revenge; you take revenge on this injustice on me by getting involved in the Islamic movement and thus establishing Islam.\u201d\n\nI was abroad most of his prison period this time, and I could not do much. I was abroad even on Dec. 10, 2013 when the prison authority told our family members to pay our last visit to my father. I took a flight immediately and reached Dhaka on the morning of Dec.11, 2013.\n\nOn the way, I was praying to Allah so that He would give me the opportunity to see my father for the last time. Praise be to Allah that He granted me that chance (as his judicial murder was deferred by two days by one judge\u2019s intervention).\n\nWhen we went to the prison again to pay our last visit in the evening of Dec. 12, 2013, my father embraced me and said: \u201cNo physical revenge; you take revenge on this injustice on me by getting involved in the Islamic movement and thus establishing Islam.\u201d\n\nWhen we left the prison, we came to know that my father\u2019s judicial murder would be executed on that night. The prison authority was supposed to hand over the dead body to us, which they did not do. Fifteen members of our family were ready to travel to our home district Faridpur where the prison authority was taking my father\u2019s dead body.\n\nFamily Beaten and Prisoned\nWe were all ready to head off and were waiting downstairs of our residence. At that time some savage ruling party Awami League hooligans attacked us with sharp weapons. Then the police surrounded us and, to our utter astonishment, started to beat us up! As we were being severely beaten by the police and forced into the police van, we all had the fear of being subject to forced disappearances. Eventually, we were taken to Ramna police station in Dhaka. After few hours when my maternal uncle and elder sister came to the police station and got us released, some among us were badly injured.\n\nWhen we returned home late at night, we were not in a condition to make it to Faridpur which is over hundred miles away from Dhaka. The police buried him hurriedly and denied us the right to see the dead body of my father.\n\nPerhaps, even in savage societies, human beings do not treat others in such a barbaric manner. My father took a first class ticket to the heaven and we are left stranded. O Allah! Give us the ability to bear the massive responsibility that my father entrusted on us!\n\nhttp:\/\/www.onislam.net\/english\/politics\/asia\/467177-mollahs-son-writing-about-last-moments.html"}
