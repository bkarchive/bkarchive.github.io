At least 24 people died as Islamists took to the streets in Cairo and other cities on Friday to vent their fury at what they say was a military coup.\n\nMorsi was elected president last year after a popular revolution swept away veteran leader Hosni Mubarak.","picture":"http:\/\/vthumb.ak.fbcdn.net\/hvthumb-ak-prn1\/1067433_127033217506245_127033120839588_45929_2018_b.jpg","source":"http:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/hvideo-ash1\/v\/t42\/1050121_127033184172915_1045121660_n.mp4?oh=5a6a7148326995e536c8ec9156f232a5&oe=52D7DBF6","name":"\u09b8\u09be\u09b2\u09be\u09ab\u09bf\u09a6\u09c7\u09b0 \u09ae\u09c1\u09b0\u09b8\u09bf\u09b0 \u09aa\u0995\u09cd\u09b7\u09c7 \u09b8\u09b6\u09b8\u09cd\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0 \u09b8\u0982\u0997\u09cd\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09c7\u09b0 \u0998\u09cb\u09b7\u09a8\u09be"}
