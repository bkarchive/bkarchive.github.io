Hence, the appointment of Judge Adli Mansour as President by the Defense Minister is a manifest violation of the Constitution and legal provisions. The decree was issued by someone who had no authority to do so, to appoint as President someone who had no right to take that position.\r\n\r\n(5) The Defense Minister\u2019s decree to suspend the Constitution is null and void. Therefore the constitutional situation remains as it were. The elected legitimate president remains unchanged and those who mounted the coup remain outside the law and the Constitution.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Democracy Defense Front calls on all states as well as international and regional organizations and all the free world not to deal with the illegitimate coup government, and to stand firm with the Egyptian people in their quest to regain their democracy and their Constitution.\r\n\r\nGod bless Egypt \u2013 free and civilian democracy\r\n\r\nDemocracy Defense Front","picture":"https:\/\/fbcdn-photos-f-a.akamaihd.net\/hphotos-ak-prn2\/969671_499664233454879_1125568584_s.jpg"}
