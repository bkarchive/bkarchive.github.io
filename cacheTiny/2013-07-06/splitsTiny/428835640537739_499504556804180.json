It should keep away from politics.\r\n\r\n\"Copts are our partners in the homeland. They must not fear for their safety, their holy places, their lives or their property. Pope Tawadros should not be talking on behalf of Egyptian Copts, because he is a religious symbol; and should not turn against the elected President.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Badie denied news about his arrest, saying, \"We are free revolutionaries. We will complete the march of the Revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will not be afraid of arrests or military rule. We have sacrificed so much to restore freedoms. We will not back down.\r\n\r\n\"God is Great. He can crush every traitor and every treacherous tyrant. The people of Egypt will protect the Revolution, and will continue to demand their rights.\"\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.ikhwanweb.com\/article.php?id=31099","picture":"http:\/\/photos-c.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-ash2\/1001354_499504543470848_1086382410_s.jpg"}
