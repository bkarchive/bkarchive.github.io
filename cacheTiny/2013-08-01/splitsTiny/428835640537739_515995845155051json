I can imagine how hard it is for Jamaat to keep patience, stay calm and make some sound decisions when it faces extreme challenges from an oppressive government and its institutions. If I had to make one quick request to Jamaat at a critical moment like this, I would, from the bottom of my heart ask Jamaat not to make any compromise with election commission regarding Jamaat's constitution. I would ask them not to even think of editing the constitution. I would suggest them Keep the constitution as it is and say loud ' When God's sovereignty comes under question No correction would ever be made to this constitution regardless what the outcome is'. \n\n-Fanpost (Aqhlak Muhamed)"}
