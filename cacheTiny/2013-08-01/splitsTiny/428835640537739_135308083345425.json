While large numbers of protesters have been arrested, the Bangladeshi authorities have made no meaningful efforts to hold members of the security forces accountable.\n\nThe 48-page report, \"Blood On The Streets: The Use of Excessive Force During Bangladesh Protests,\" is based on 95 interviews with victims and their family members, witnesses, human rights defenders, journalists, and lawyers. The report documents case after case in which police, the paramilitary Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), and the Border Guards Bangladesh (BGB) opened fire into crowds or beat protesters in a brutal and unlawful manner. In some cases, security forces carried out extrajudicial executions. Human Rights Watch also documented the killing of at least a dozen members of the security forces and police officers over the course of the protests, as well as three members of the ruling Awami League party.","picture":"http:\/\/vthumb.ak.fbcdn.net\/hvthumb-ak-ash3\/1095570_135308196678747_135308083345425_50284_1475_b.jpg","source":"http:\/\/video.ak.fbcdn.net\/hvideo-ak-ash3\/v\/t42\/760336_135308173345416_1054973035_n.mp4?oh=c487c0d26f2861de11be40464da0ccb7&oe=52D82060&__gda__=1389891822_e1494c84238e4073f58de8089eab09d0","name":"\u09ac\u09bf\u0995\u09cd\u09b7\u09cb\u09ad\u0995\u09be\u09b0\u09c0\u09a6\u09c7\u09b0 \u0989\u09aa\u09b0 \u09aa\u09c1\u09b2\u09bf\u09b6-\u09b0\u200c\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u09ac\u09c7\u09b0 \u09b9\u09a4\u09cd\u09af\u09be \u09a8\u09bf\u09df\u09c7 \u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09be\u09a8\u09cd\u09af\u099a\u09bf\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0-HRW"}
