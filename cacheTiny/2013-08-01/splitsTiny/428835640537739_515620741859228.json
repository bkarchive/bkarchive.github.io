It was beyond my knowledge that someone can curtail his own powers,\u201d said Menon.\r\nThe BNP alleges that the EC\u2019s move is motivated and is aimed at favouring a certain political party.\r\n\u201cIf this authority is scrapped, the commission cannot do anything even if ballot boxes are snatched. In such cases, the commission will have to ask the aggrieved party to go to court to seek remedy,\u201d said MK Anwar.\r\nHe also blasted the EC for its draft electoral code of conduct which allows the prime minister and 20 ministers to participate in electioneering in the next parliamentary polls.\r\nHe warned of staging agitations, demanding formation of a neutral EC if the commission did not stop its current activities.","picture":"http:\/\/photos-g.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-ash3\/1006320_515620731859229_1545458252_s.jpg"}
