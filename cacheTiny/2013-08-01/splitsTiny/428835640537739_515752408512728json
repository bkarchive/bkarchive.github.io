If it amends its charter, to bring it in conformity with the constitution and reapplies for registration, it can be re-registered.\"\r\n\r\nWar crimes tribunal 'sham'\r\n\r\nThere were fears ahead of the ruling that it could trigger fresh protests by Jamaat supporters in the politically volatile country, already reeling from violence over war crimes verdicts passed on Jamaat's top leadership.\r\n\r\nPolice and members of the elite Rapid Action Battalion were deployed outside the court in central Dhaka, but there were no immediate reports of violence.\r\n\r\nThe ruling comes after a leading Sufi group, which practises Islamic mysticism, filed the public interest litigation in January 2009 seeking to scrap Jamaat's registration.\r\n\r\nSecular protesters have long demanded that Jamaat be banned for its role in the 1971 war of independence, during which it opposed Bangladesh's breakaway from Pakistan.\r\n\r\nTop Jamaat leaders are being tried for crimes during the war and four of them have been sentenced to death for murder, mass murder, rape and religious persecution in Bangladesh's controversial International Crimes Tribunal, which is not endorsed by the UN and has been criticised by rights groups.\r\n\r\nProtests over the verdicts have sparked violence that has left at least 150 people dead during street clashes with security forces, Human Rights Watch said in a report released on Thursday.\r\n\r\nJamaat has said that the trials are a sham aimed at eliminating the party, which is a key opposition force.","picture":"https:\/\/fbcdn-photos-g-a.akamaihd.net\/hphotos-ak-ash3\/1387_515752401846062_348013169_s.jpg"}
