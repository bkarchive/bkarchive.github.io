There is fundamental wrong with the fifth amendment issued by a corrupt judge. Everything seems to be geared towards achieving Sheikh Mujibs Baksal. Those biological retarded secularist should know Bangladesh independence was not fought to establish secularism, and ungodly satanic society. As a Muslim I can not accept a constitution which does not give my rights to do Islamic politics based on Islamic principle, therefore, we should vehemently oppose this constitution which is one sided and flawed, and do everything to change the government so that the constitution could be put to a referendum. As for today\u2019s verdict, it stinks like dead rat. Those Pir Murid partys that brought the writ against Jamat are themselves party to promoting Satanic ideology in their Mazars and among their Murids. They believe in one part of the Quran and discard the other. They are a disease in our Islamic society and people should reject them. I see no point in going to court; the court will only do what their master orders them to do. Only force, striving and struggling against them would bring about a change.\r\n\r\nMozafor Ali","picture":"http:\/\/photos-b.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-prn2\/970307_515791015175534_294016455_s.jpg"}
