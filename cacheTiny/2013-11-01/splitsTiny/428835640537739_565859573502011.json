We\u2019d like to speak outspokenly that the ongoing movement of Chhatrashibir together with the student segment can in no way be deactivated. The Awami government must suffer a lot in near future if it, out of its nasty political envy, goes on with its dirty agenda of arresting our leaders and activists.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe urged the government and the law enforcement agencies to shun undemocratic actions, refrain from arresting Shibir leaders as well as activists and stop filing false cases against them.","picture":"http:\/\/photos-h.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-prn1\/545899_565859553502013_516593582_s.jpg"}
