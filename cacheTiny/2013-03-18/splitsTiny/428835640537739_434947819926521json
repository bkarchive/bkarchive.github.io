Hasanuzzaman, Scientific Officer, Bangladesh Institute of Nuclear Agriculture (BINA). He was a student of Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU). His 4 years aged son (Named Saneem) is suffering from 'Pulmonary Atresia' disease. To conduct the treatment of the baby need around 30,000-35,000 USD. Bearing this much of treatment cost is really not possible for brother Hasanuzzaman. So he requested for your kind cooperation to treat his son. Brother, please keep this little baby in your prayer.\r\n\r\nAnd they give food in spite of love for it to the needy, the orphan, and the captive, [Saying], \"We feed you only for the countenance of Allah . We wish not from you reward or gratitude (Al-quran, Surat Al-'Ins\u0101n, Ayah 8-9).","picture":"https:\/\/fbcdn-photos-b-a.akamaihd.net\/hphotos-ak-ash3\/554972_434947809926522_2117621252_s.jpg"}
