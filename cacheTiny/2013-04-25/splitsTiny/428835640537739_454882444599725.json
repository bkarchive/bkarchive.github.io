Are they alive? Last six hours, I saw more than 300 dead bodies. I was talking with an Army Officer. He informed me, total death is more than 3000. But, I am really disappointing to see the role of our media. They were busy to take photo & video. For them, people cannot work properly. And When a person was shouting help me help me from the dead valley, A journalist of a TV was trying to take his interview.\nBut the role of Army surprised me because, they were just standing and watching, how GENERAL PEOPLE are working with a high life risk. When I was entering in the whole, It was to tough to take breath because of the lacking of Oxygen. I cannot walk, even I cannot sit there. I entered into the whole like a snake. When I went there, I just saw lots of dead body, which are in messy condition. What I saw there. What should I do? Cry for them? Try to Save them?\nNow I want to make a war against the cruel owner of the garments who treat labors just as labors not as human being and the politicians who do not care humanity. Lets break them.\n\n- \u09b2\u09bf\u099c\u09be-\u09b0 \u09b2\u09bf\u0996\u09be\u09b0 \u0985\u09ac\u09b2\u09ae\u09cd\u09ac\u09a8\u09c7"}
