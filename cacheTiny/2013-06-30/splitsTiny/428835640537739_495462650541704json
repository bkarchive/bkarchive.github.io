Think. A year to unravel 30 years of deep corruption.\nShort solutions to deep problems are not the way forward, especially since the country is still in its first phase of democracy.\nDon't like Morsi? Fine. Diversity is key to a healthy society.\nBut you can't order him to step down. He was democratically elected. Want him gone? Boot him out with the ballot boxes.\nPeace.#SaveEgypt\n\nZara Kadir"}
