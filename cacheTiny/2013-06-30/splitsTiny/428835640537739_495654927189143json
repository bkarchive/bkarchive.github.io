It is highly suspected that he has been abducted by Bangladesh security forces like many other cases where active indication from fascist ruling party has made many opposition leaders and workers vanish. Only in few cases, remains of the deceased persons are recovered while, in most cases, whereabouts of the people missing are unknown with no traces. \r\nIn the GD application to Mohammadpur Thana, Md. Motiur Rahman, elder brother of Jakir Hossain, reported that Mohammad Jakir went out from house no. 19\/6 Tkkapara, 2nd Floor, flat no. 4\/e, Mohammadpur on 2nd April night at 8.00 PM heading to Dental College Institute in order to collect some important papers. He was an Internee student of Dental College of Dhaka Institute of Medical technology. After that departure, he did not come back and no news has been found about his location and condition even after much searching measure which continues still now. \r\nBesides, we have informed that white-dressed people in the name of law enforcing agencies arrested him from his house on 2nd April at night. But, when we contacted with Mohammadpur Shia Masjid RAB Camp 2, Police stations of Adabor and Mohammadpur thana in search of Jakir Hossain, they denied any responsibility and claimed that he was not arrested by any security force that night. Leaders of Islami Chhatrashibir expressed deep concern over the disappearance of a talented student like Jakir Hussain and also a future doctor. It was also predicted that this incidence was a continuance of ongoing secret killing campaign by Awami Fascist Government which reached its maximum this time and surpassed any previous record by its magnitude of suppression, torture and secret killing of opposition leaders.","picture":"https:\/\/fbcdn-photos-g-a.akamaihd.net\/hphotos-ak-ash3\/942326_495654900522479_1325471109_s.jpg"}
