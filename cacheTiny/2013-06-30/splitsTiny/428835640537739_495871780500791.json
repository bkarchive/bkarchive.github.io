He, by his dirty remark, stimulated Jubo League goons to bar Chhatrashibir from holding its regular democratic agenda. The whole nation is totally infuriated due to such irresponsible say of the Home Minister holding a crucial public office.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cChhatrashibir called off the announced shutdown due to disastrous weather and this is why this ideal outfit deserves massive acclamation. But, instead, the Home Minister violently reacted to the timely decision of Chhatrashibir by saying- \u2018Chhatrashibir got trembled\u2019. Such say only suits an odd jerk. Thereby he proved himself to be the Godfather of Jubo League goons, rather than a responsible minister.\u201d\n\nShibir Secretary-General urged the Home Minister to refrain from uttering such things any more and to take concrete measures to better the law and order situation."}
