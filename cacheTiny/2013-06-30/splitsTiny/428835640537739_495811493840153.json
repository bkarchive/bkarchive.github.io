We both walked away from the rubble.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe spent two days in hospital but then she vanished. The next time I saw her was on TV 17 days later. They said it was a miracle. But it was a fake.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Sunday Mirror travelled to Bangladesh to meet anti-government campaigners who insist the rescue was staged by the authorities to combat the wave of bad publicity that engulfed the country\u2019s \u00a31billion-a-year garment industry after the Rana Plaza factory collapsed in Dhaka.\r\n\r\nWe were played a recording of the worker\u2019s evidence. His name is being withheld because he has gone into hiding amid fear of reprisals.\r\n\r\nHis dramatic hoax claims have been investigated by journalists from Dhaka\u2019s pro-opposition daily, Amar Desh.\r\n\r\nReporters there were also told by survivor Reshma\u2019s landlady that she had escaped the collapse on the day it happened and had been treated at the nearby Enam hospital.\r\n\r\nPeople who live on streets around the factory described how they were mysteriously forcibly evacuated from their homes the day before 19-year-old Reshma\u2019s rescue and allowed back the next day with no explanation.\r\n\r\nAt the same time a 24-hour ban was imposed on the filming of the ongoing rescue operation.\r\n\r\nQuestions have also been raised over Reshma\u2019s physical appearance when she was taken from the ruins as well as the condition of her clothes.\r\n\r\nInvestigative reporter Shishir Abdullah said: \u201cShe did not show any signs of having been trapped beneath tons of rubble for 17 days.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe said she had to claw her way through bricks and debris to reach water in dead victims\u2019 rucksacks, but her hands and fingernails did not show the marks you would expect.\r\n\r\n\u201cAlso her eyes were wide open when they pulled her out and she did not appear to be sensitive to the bright sunlight. The sari she wore was not ripped or torn and appeared clean.\r\n\r\n\u201cPeople were suspicious but the government made a huge fuss of hailing it as a miracle. People were taken in. Everyone was fooled.\u201d\r\n\r\nA week ago, illiterate Reshma was paraded at a government press conference in a new job as an ambassador for a five-star Dhaka hotel, where she is being paid \u00a3600-a-month - 10 times the average salary.\r\n\r\nShe reacted angrily to suggestions of a hoax, saying: \u201cWhere I was, you were not there. So you have no idea.\u201d Officials then banned further questions. It has been claimed Reshma was given the job after turning down the offer of a new life in the US.\r\n\r\nOn Friday we travelled to Rani Ganj, the remote village where Reshma grew up 300 miles north west of Dhaka, the country\u2019s capital.\r\n\r\nSpeaking at her family home \u2013 a tiny, single-room mud shack with a straw roof \u2013 her mother Jobeda refuted the hoax claims, telling us: \u201cHer escape IS the miracle everyone thinks it is.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut she added: \u201cWe have lots of money now Reshma has her new job. We have a good future now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAfter we heard the building had collapsed we were so worried. My husband and I travelled to Dhaka and waited with the other families for news. We prayed Reshma would be found but our prayers went unanswered.\u201d\r\n\r\nOn May 10, the 17th day of the rescue operation, an announcement was made over a loudspeaker erected at the site to keep families informed.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt said, \u2018A woman has been found alive. Her name is Reshma\u2019.\u201d\r\n\r\nJobeda said: \u201cI fainted. When I came round, people took me to the hospital to see her. She was awake and spoke to us. She told us she was happy.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe had just minor marks on her arms but otherwise she was fine. I was overjoyed. I couldn\u2019t believe how lucky she had been. The army were looking after her. When she was well enough, she left and was then given her new job at the hotel. She will send us money and we are expecting her to come home and visit us twice a year.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe slum-dwelling victims of the collapse worked for just \u00a31 a day making jeans for Primark in the UK and other stores around the world.\r\n\r\nTheir complaints of cracks in the factory\u2019s walls in the days before the collapse on April 24 were ignored by the wealthy owners, who had added an extra three floors to the building without permission. They are now under arrest and facing demands for the death penalty for flouting planning laws. A survey by engineers in Bangladesh revealed earlier this month three fifths of the country\u2019s garment factories are vulnerable to collapse.\r\n\r\nWhen we put the hoax rescue claims to the Bangladesh army last night, spokesman Lieutenant Commander Nure Alam Siddique said: \u201cWe have no comment to make.\u201d","picture":"http:\/\/photos-g.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-ash2\/1009757_495811473840155_1807809571_s.jpg"}
