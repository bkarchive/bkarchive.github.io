Till today, there is no scope to find him out.\r\n \r\nAnwarul Islam Masum was arrested from his home on 4th April 2013 by some RAB-5 personnel as well as about 40-50 law enforcement agency men at midnight at 2.30 am. Those law enforcement personnel repressed on him for one hour into his home to lock the door in the name of detention and they took his picture to keep their own arms in front of him according to the General Diary of Masum\u2019s mother. That day about 10-15 DB members took him to a local student mess hall at around 5.15 am and searched therein when many of the mess members saw him. But on next day, when his family went in search of his whereabouts, Rab-5 authority denied their liability and they didn\u2019t take him to the court too within 24 hours after the arrest as per the legal mandate. So, his family has arranged a press briefing on 7 April 2013 and presented credible documents of their beloved member\u2019s arrest by law enforcement agency personnel.\r\nBut till now the law enforcement agency did not admit that dirty operation. Is he arrested or abducted or disappeared forever?- this is query!!!","picture":"https:\/\/fbcdn-photos-d-a.akamaihd.net\/hphotos-ak-ash3\/9041_495657280522241_1654087721_s.jpg"}
