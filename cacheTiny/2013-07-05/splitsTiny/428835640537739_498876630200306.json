More and more people, 1000s here. This is the point between the TV building where pro-Morsi protesters and people from Tahrir where anti-Morsi protesters were camped out. And as people heard pro-Morsi people were coming on, they came towards the bridge and that\u2019s where clashes started happening. I can\u2019t see any police or military around where I am, it has been reported that military has been deployed here but I can\u2019t see. All I see is people throwing whatever they can and it is a very intense situation.\n\n    I can see the gap between pro and anti-Morsi protesters. I can see the entire bridge and more people are arriving from both sides\n\n    Now I can see ambulances arriving but with this number of people there is no way they can enter.\n\n    There are many different areas the bridge goes down into streets below. Lots of fireworks around, still the sounds of popping which might be birdshots but mainly stones and sticks are used."}
