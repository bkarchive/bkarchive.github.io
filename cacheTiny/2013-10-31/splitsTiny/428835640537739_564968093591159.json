The inspectors would check the validity of workers' residency cards and their professions.\nViolators face fines of up to SR100,000, two years in prison, or both for repeat offenders. Security sources told Arab News earlier that the District Police Department had formed a task force comprising personnel from various police and security agencies.\nAbu Thunain said the task force would cover pharmacies, barbershops, restaurants, security guards and drivers.\nThe source said that workers must have valid work contracts stamped by the chamber of commerce in their city of residence. Citizens would be fined for employing foreign workers not under their sponsorship.\nIn addition, foreign workers found working on their own, with the approval and authorization of their sponsors, would be regarded as violators. Their sponsors would also be fined.\nForeign workers with driver's licenses can drive cars regardless of their original profession, the source said.\nThe government would also fine workers if their iqamas have expired, they do not carry their iqamas or run away from inspectors. There are also penalties for people sheltering pilgrims who overstayed their Haj and Umrah visas.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.arabnews.com\/news\/470206","picture":"http:\/\/photos-c.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-prn2\/t1\/1451487_564968086924493_1696177169_s.jpg"}
