Their silence on Bangladesh is as deadening as it has been on Syria. What a pitiful situation this is! \r\nIt is perhaps not fair to expect a world with two faces to respond to this new atrocity with honor and honesty. \r\nThis is why we should seek support and mercy from the One who is the ultimate source of all power and love. \r\nWe are only as powerful as the length of words we can write or shout slogan as loud we can do.\r\n Thus, we call on the tyrants to stop their cruelties, for they should know that whatever the reasons they have committed them, it will not bring happiness. Happiness comes with virtuousness! \r\nWe ask these leaders: who is your guide? Do not be mistaken by the fact that these tyrants happen to be in Muslim countries \u2013 this does not qualify them to be the rightful followers of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, for the Prophet.\r\nWe hope these tyrants are brought to their senses as soon as possible, so that we are saved from our failure to fulfill our basic human responsibilities to stand up for life and dignity. \r\nIn the meantime, we seek guidance and hope in the Almighty, because ultimately, He is the one with the power to bring these events under control. \r\nAs we are so often reminded, our human capabilities are quite limited.","picture":"http:\/\/photos-c.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-ash3\/1524699_605866579501310_506145222_s.jpg"}
