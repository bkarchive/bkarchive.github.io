Unless our leaders are trying to suggest they are unnaturally elevated and beyond the reproach of citizens who they are in fact, completely answerable to, they should discourage this from happening again in the future.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.dhakatribune.com\/editorial\/2013\/oct\/11\/emperor%E2%80%99s-new-clothes#sthash.yaLLOU6L.dpuf"}
