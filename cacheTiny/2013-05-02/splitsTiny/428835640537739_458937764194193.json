Don\u2019t forget to take the travellers essential with you, never know what situation you will have to face on that day. Our resolve is to establish the rule of law, preserve our religious values, independence, equality, democracy and justice. 5th of May is a very important semi final for the nation that we must win. If we can show our political prudence and resolve, we may not have the need to play the final, as our tyrant rulers, by then would have fled the country in to abyss of history. But, there is a big \u201cBut\u201d As we plan, so they too plan; the idea is to defeat them without being defeated. Their allies are Shaiateen of the leftist and Nastik. Any failures on our part could cost us very dearly for our future generation; especially our Islamic identity and democratic values will be shortened and replaced with extreme secularism and one party rule. So we must not be complacent but be on top of our enemy with firmness and determination so that they implode from within.\r\n\r\nRemember, they plan to deceive the opposition with promises and words until they can sit out the storm past June. Don\u2019t let them the luxury of time. Brothers and sisters in Islam, why not be the first to make history? Be the first to register your name with Allah in defence of your faith and religion and against tyranny and disbelief. Allah says, \u201cAnd yet another blessing that you love: help from Allah and a victory at hand; and give good news to the believers.\u201d","picture":"http:\/\/photos-a.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-ash3\/168245_458937750860861_573908754_s.jpg"}
