Processions were launched in as many as 535 places countrywide including 45 alone in the capital. Cops as well as goons of Awami League, Jubo League and Chhatra League opened fire at the protesters and picketers while holding peaceful demos and gatherings whereby 65 Shibir men got injured. The police unjustly apprehended 45 Shibir men today.\r\n\r\nShibir leaders said while addressing post-demo gatherings in different places and points of the country, \u201cThe Awami government is being detached from the masses due to its massive corruption and conspiracies against Islam and the nation. This is why they are daydreaming to hang on power by holding a sham election under the pro-party interim government system and ergo they have scrapped the non-party caretaker government system. The cancellation of Jamaat\u2019s registration has deepened the crisis in national politics. The student segment is always against such autocratic actions of the government and detached the capital city from the rest of the country by effectualizing ceaseless shutdowns. We\u2019d like to clearly say that no election under party government shall be allowed to take place in the country.\u201d","picture":"http:\/\/photos-d.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-prn2\/t1\/1465196_572152942872674_1863418312_s.jpg"}
