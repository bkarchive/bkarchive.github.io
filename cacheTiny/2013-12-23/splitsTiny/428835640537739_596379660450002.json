honorable countrymen!\nAssalamu alaikum!!\n\nIslamic Movement in Bangladesh, especially Jamaat-e-Islami as well as Chhatrashibir, is braving multi-dimensional conspiracies of the current Awami government.\n\nThe government is oppressing and killing Jamaat-Shibir men by policemen, RAB, BGB and other pro-party thugs on the one hand and, on the other hand, it\u2019s branding those \u2018oppressed\u2019 as terrorists.\n\nMoreover, attempts are being made to bar Chhatrashibir from conveying its messages and statements to the masses.\n\nSome print and electronic media have been shut down for their role against undemocratic actions of the government.\n\nContrarily, false propaganda is being aired through polarized media.\n\nThe Central Office of Chhatrashibir has been sealed for over two years.\n\nCops attacked and locked the Central Office on 19 September 2011.\n\nThe office is still under lock and key.\n\nBut, the government is yet to pass any explanation as to why the office of a remarkable student outfit is forcibly closed.\n\nOffices of the Metropolitan, District and Thana level units of the organization are also closed accordingly.\n\nBut, every now and then, cops raid, in the name of operation, the few offices which are still open and nab as well as torture leaders and activists from there.\n\nPolicemen, BGB and RAB personnel have gone reckless these days as they are ordered so by the government.\n\nThey are religiously violating human rights.\n\nThe government has made a worst type of example of state-patronized terrorism by torturing and killing Shibir men using these state-oriented forces.\n\nThe government went crazier after it had killed Abdul Quader Molla, the prominent Islamic thinker and Assistant Secretary-General of Jamaat-e-Islami.\n\nThe state-backed forces made crude attacks on the people infuriated by the judicial killing (of Molla) in various districts so that they (people) cannot protest.\n\nThis is just a newer version of Awami \u2018garrison force\u2019 (of Mujib era).\n\nOn last 14 December, RAB personnel killed Dr. Foyez Ahmed, Vice-President (Nayeb-e-Ameer) of Lokkhipur District Jamaat unit, at his own residence. \n\nThey took him to the top floor, shot him to death and pushed him down on the ground.\n\nOn the same day, cops shot dead 7 Shibir men in Noakhali.\n\nNext day, on 15 December, 3 more Shibir men were shot dead.\n\nDuring the wee hours on that day, joint forces made inhuman attack in the name of \u2018operation\u2019 in Satkhira.\n\n 7 Shibir men were killed in that attack.\n\nBesides, cops vandalized houses of some leaders including Chief of District Jamaat unit.\n\nNumerous houses of innocent villagers have been leveled with bulldozers.\n\nPolicemen, BGB and RAB personnel tortured on those who dared to protest.\n\nOn the same day, 3 Shibir men plus a van driver were shot dead by cops in Joypurhat.\n\nLater, 2 more were added to the death toll as an injured female Jamaat activist and another one hurt died.\n\nThus, personnel of law enforcement agencies have been ceaselessly killing leaders as well as activists of Jamaat and Shibir.\n\nIn this situation, Awami League leaders ordered Chhatra League men to be accomplices to the law enforcers.\n\nHence, it\u2019s very easy to presume armed Chhatra League terrorists will commit havoc across the land.\n\nMedia revealed that every Chhatra League leader in Rajshahi University has loaded pistols.\n\nChhatra League Leaders all over the country have been provided with arms.\n\nCountrymen know very well what is happening and what more will come out by blessings of these arms.\n\nThis issue has been recently talked about much in the letter sent to the UN by Asian Human Rights Commission seeking intervention of UN in Bangladesh\u2019s human rights situation.\n\nThe mass media is not that vocal against human rights violation by state-backed terrorism in Bangladesh.\n\nFirstly, the government shut down the Daily Amardesh, Diganta TV and Islamic TV as these media dared to speak against government\u2019s undemocratic and human rights violating actions.\n\nSecondly, it is airing news and information contrary to the facts by its polarized media.\n\nThreats are being posed to the media concerned so that they don\u2019t even dare to publish any piece of news and information that goes against the government.\n\nOn 16 December night, pro-government thugs raided, as per the announcement made earlier, the office of the Daily Sangram, an ancient prominent daily, and attacked as well as fired into the residence of Shafiq Rehman, an eminent journalist of the country.\n\nThe partisan media are publishing false and fabricated reports against Chhatrashibir connecting Shibir with the incidents of oppression on minority, attacks on judges\u2019 houses, arson in buses, vandalism and attacks on cops etc though they have no sort of evidence in this regard.\n\nAlthough there remain documentary evidence of terrorist link with these events against the pro-government thugs and goons, most media are not airing or at least not daring to air the fact.\n\nOn last 14 December, the Police nabbed 3 Chhatra League men with petrol bombs during the attack on the residence of Jahangir Hussen, a judge to the International Crimes Tribunal-1.\n\nBut, most of the media tried to skip involvement of Chhatra League cadres in this incident.\n\nOn the same day, 15 to 20 masked terrorists torched several houses of the Hindu community in Satkhira.\n\nAt that time, a Jubo League cadre, from among those masked terrorists, was apprehended.\n\nOn last 6 December, cops arrested a Jubo League activist who in disguise joined a procession of Chhatrashibir and threw pieces of bricks at the car of Army.\n\nMoreover, media revealed involvement of Chhatra League and Jubo League cadres in the events of train derailment and attacks on buses by chanting pro-BNP-Jamaat slogans.\n\nBut, regrettably, these sorts of factual news are not coming in the limelight as the government throttled the media in most cases.\n\nThese facts prove that Chhatra League and Jubo League cadres, of course not Chhatrashibir, are principally as well as directly behind the nasty events of arson in buses, setting houses of Hindu community on fire and making attacks on judges\u2019 residences.\n\nThe government is causing such incidents to happen by its party-goons to falsely accuse Chhatrashibir.\n\nMoreover, thousands of Shibir leaders and activists are being nabbed upon false charges regarding these events.\n\nSome mass media are directly engaging in playing such dramas staged by the government.\n\nBuses were set ablaze even in front of cops which further clarifies the drama.\n\nChhatrashibir is launching its movement across the country in a way that is peaceful and disciplined.\n\nThough the government is killing Shibir men brutally, continuous directives are being sent from concerned leaders to all who belong to this organization not to go outside the purview of the systemic movement effort of this outfit. \n\nArmed with utmost possible patience, leaders and activists of Chhatrashibir are, by infinite mercy of Allah, ramping up disciplined movement despite umpteenth trials and tribulations.\n\nOn the other hand, the government is frequently stimulating Chhatrashibir to go violent like Chhatra League and Jubo League goons.\n\nThis way, the government wants to brand Chhatrashibir as a \u2018terrorist outfit\u2019 to the world.\n\nBut, all such conspiracies of the government failed very abjectly due to patience, consciousness and bravery of Shibir leaders and activists.\n\nWe again and again said that Chhatrashibir has no connection with any attack or arson.\n\nChhatrashibir believes in ideological politics.\n\nHence Shibir men are fortified and disciplined.\n\nThey know that peaceful mass-protest is far more powerful than the power of muscle.\n\nThe countrymen don\u2019t at all count the false propaganda aired against Chhatrashibir.\n\nMost of the mass media in many cases failed to prove their manly bravery as they denied airing the rejoinders and protest statements of Chhatrashibir against false and fabricated reports.\n\nThey just shout blindly and accuse Chhatrashibir after every incident occurs but could never point out exactly which Shibir man is connected with such incidents.\n\nWe are sure, if the media are ever impartial and look into the events justly, names of Chhatra League and Jubo League cadres will finally be found behind all the ongoing untoward events.\n\nThe propaganda of Shibir\u2019s attack on law enforcers doesn\u2019t hold any water at all.\n\nBecause, statistics show that Policemen, RAB personnel and Chhatra League-Jubo League terrorists killed over 300 Jamaat-Shibir men over last 5 years.\n\nAbout 86000 cases have been filed against Jamaat and Shibir across the land.\n\nAbout 5 lakh Shibir men were charged in these cases.\n\n62000 leaders and activists of Chhatrashibir have been arrested in this regard.\n\n8 Shibir leaders including Al-Muqaddas and Waliullah of Islamic University fell victim to enforced disappearance by the personnel of the law enforcement agencies.\n\nOf them, several are still traceless.\n\nHundreds of leaders and activists got crippled.\n\nMany lost their eyes.\n\nThese statistics prove that Chhatrashibir is severely victimized and the government has been killing and oppressing Shibir men through state-backed terrorism.\n\nThe Awami government has been much intolerant since it came to power through last polls.\n\nWhile oppressing Jamaat and Shibir men, the government is not even leaving out Islamic theological experts and Madrasah students.\n\nThe situation reached such abysmal state that a person living in a large Muslim majority state feels insecure to introduce himself as a madrasah student.\n\nOn the contrary, the atheistic forces backed by the government are egoistically living their lives on the earth.\n\nThe government made country\u2019s independence and sovereignty seriously vulnerable.\n\nOn the one hand, it signed pacts with India one after another that go against interests of the country.\n\nOn the other hand, it facilitated the way India can interfere in by pushing the country to instability pre-planned.\n\nDuring her visit to Bangladesh, what the Indian Foreign Secretary said is nothing but naked interference in Bangladesh\u2019s internal affairs.\n\nBut, the government made no protest against such behavior of hers.\n\nAwami League\u2019s daydream to hang on power with backing of India is now clear to all.\n\nMovement to safeguard Islam and country\u2019s independence as well as sovereignty is in progress throughout the country.\n\nChhatrashibir is just ramping up peaceful protests with the student segment against all types of unjust actions of the government.\n\nThe government is creating anarchy and instability in the country in a planned way to divert the freedom-seeking people from their protests.\n\nStatistics and analyses put above connote this fact.\n\nThe mass media is being used to shift anarchy and vandalism committed by the government upon the shoulders of Chhatrashibir.\n\nPositive journalism these days yielded to the muscle power and worldly gains.\n\nOur media is shamelessly being used to serve the ill purposes of Awami League.\n\nSome cock and bull stories are usually concocted after occurrence of every incident to blame Chhatrashibir.\n\nThe same media keep mum when the real fact is revealed later.\n\nA class of government high-ups and polarized media made snap statements against Chhatrashibir after the killing of Biswajit.\n\nRecently, Chhatra League cadres are proven guilty and punished with various sentences including death penalty and life imprisonment by the court.\n\nBut the people who blamed Chhatrashibir earlier for this murder got totally dumb after court verdict is handed down of late against Chhatra League goons.\n\nHundreds of such examples are available.\n\nWe\u2019d like to say that Chhatrashibir is not connected with any sort of vandalism or anarchy, let alone \u2018murder\u2019.\n\nIf fair trial is launched through impartial probe, even no remoter connection of Chhatrashibir with any untoward and unjust incident can be found.\n\nWe think partisan actions of the polarized media are, on the one hand, helping the real culprits escape and, on the other hand, letting injustices be done to the innocent people.\n\nThe aggrieved people are being deprived of justice they are entitled to.\n\nSo, we think the mass media should be more careful and committed to publishing factual news.\n\nAll we are doing is nothing but peaceful protests.\n\nIt\u2019s our constitutional and democratic right.\n\nThe student segment cannot be detached from this peaceful protest on the excuse and propagation of so-called \u2018vandalism\u2019.\n\nPeaceful movement of the student segment will go on and on.\n\nOur peaceful movement cannot be deactivated by means of conspiracies, propagation of \u2018vandalism\u2019 or state-backed forces.\n\nWe urge all the students of the country to engage in the movement against the oppressive government.\n\nSuccess in the ongoing student movement will somehow determine future trends and developments of Bangladesh.\n\nIf the current regime can accede to power once more, Bangladesh will essentially turn into \u2018Sikkim\u2019.\n\nThis is why we\u2019d like to urge all the countrymen to oust the current oppressive Awami regime through all-out movement.\n\nAllah Hafez,\nLong Live Bangladesh,\nLong Live Bangladesh Islami Chhatrashibir."}
