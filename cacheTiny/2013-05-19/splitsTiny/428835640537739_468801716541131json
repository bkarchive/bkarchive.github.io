Home Minister MK Alamgir and LGRD and Cooperatives Minister Syed Ashraful Islam have provided varying explanations for the restriction. Alamgir says the ban has been imposed to maintain law and order and prevent subversive acts while Ashraf says it is for the sake of smooth relief and rehabilitation activities in the Cyclone Mahasen-ravaged districts.\r\n\r\nSeeing through the web of deceit \r\n\r\nBefore I give any comment, here is a bit of news to liven up campaigners for some time. All those campaigns on twitter, facebook and the streets are having an effect. Some big people have shaken up and started to get acquainted with the possibility of another official BAKSHAL. Sixteen newspaper editors have asked for the release of Daily Amar Desh acting editor Mahmudur Rahman, saying that his arrest and continued detention was a threat to the freedom of press. In a statement on Saturday, they also expressed concern about the closure of Amar Desh press and two TV stations. The statement said that both the Islamic TV and Diganta TV should be allowed to go on air and Amar Desh should be allowed to print and circulate. The editors who signed the statement were Daily Independent\u2019s Mahbubul Alam, Samakal\u2019s Golam Sarowar, Prothom Alo\u2019s Motiur Rahman, New Age\u2019s Nurul Kabir, Daily Today\u2019s Riaz Uddin Ahmed, Kaler Kantha\u2019s Imdadul Haque Milon, Daily Star\u2019s Mahfuz Anam, Daily Sangbad\u2019s acting editor Muniruzzaman and Manabjamin\u2019s Motiur Rahman Chowdhury. The statement was also signed by \u2013 Daily Inqilab\u2019s AMM Bahauddin, Naya Diganta\u2019s Alamgir Mohiuddin, Financial Express\u2019 AHM Moazzem Hossain, Bangladesh Pratidin\u2019s Naem Nizam, New Nation\u2019s Mostofa Kamal Majumder, Jugantar executive editor Saiful Alam and online news portal banglanews24.com\u2019s Alamgir Hossain. This is a copy of their signed statement.\r\n\r\nWhat can I say?\r\n\r\nIt is time we get united in facing the BAKSHAL at our doorsteps. The one month ban will give way to Ramadan, where the Awami League government believes devout Muslims will go to fast, both spiritually and physically, culminating in a weaker opposition to its autocratic rule. All eyes in the government seem to be focused on finishing this term. Few people understand what Hasina really wants to prove through all this hocus-pocus, especially when the whole wide world is widely watching. \r\n\r\nIn anticipation of better days ahead.\r\n\r\nWallahu Aa\u2019lam. \r\nPosted by Talukder Shaheb \r\nhttp:\/\/talukdershaheb.blogspot.ca\/2013\/05\/removal-of-internet-ban-in-bangladesh.html","picture":"https:\/\/fbcdn-photos-e-a.akamaihd.net\/hphotos-ak-ash2\/310257_468801663207803_1047776558_s.png"}
