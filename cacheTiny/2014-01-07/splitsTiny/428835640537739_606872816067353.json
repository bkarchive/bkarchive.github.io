Cops opened fire at the picketers and injured the same in many parts of the country. 55 Shibir men got shot at and injured by the cops. 27 more have been arrested unjustly.\r\n\r\nShibir leaders said while carrying out today\u2019s shutdown, \u201cThe countrymen have sent a red signal to the Awami government by boycotting the farcical election. Such a polling as is void of voters as a whole and marked with vote-rigging is really unprecedented in the world history. Despite all these facts, Awami League made its enslaved Election Commission declare the Awami candidates as winners through a sham election. This way, Awami League once again disclosed its dirty face and facets to the world. But, no prudent person accepted this sham election. Many national as well as international organizations including the United Nations, Commonwealth, United States, United Kingdom, Russia etc rejected this election by denying overseeing it. Meanwhile, the whole country is at stake due to mass-movement demanding cancellation of this electoral farce. Awami League is sure to meet another abject situation if it doesn\u2019t cancel the farcical election without further delay.\u201d","picture":"http:\/\/photos-c.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-prn1\/t1\/1560586_606872619400706_1744064990_s.jpg"}
