For example the current parliament is dissoled on 22nd january then election must be held within 22nd April. Therefore argument advanced by the Prime Minister that the constitution will be violated if the general elections don't take place on 5th january is misconceived and unlawful.\n\n-Shishir Mohammad Manir"}
