Al Jazeera has evidence that suggests more people were killed by the security services than the government's figure. When the reporter asked Ms Dipu Moni about the figures, she lied again and claimed that those who were reportedly dead were actually pretending to be dead. They came back to life when the police nudged them gently. I did not know whether to laugh or cry, how can a foreign minister even say anything so dumb! I was dismayed by her remark! \n\nWhen she was pressed for an independent enquiry into the Sundays massacre, she said, the government did not see the need for it as there was no foul play. In other words, the security services did nothing wrong and therefore there will no independent enquiry. Again the AL government is trying to cover up their failure and trying to pull wool over our eyes. It is astonishing that they think their evil will escape the worlds eyes. \n\nThe AL government is trying to hide the truth and pretend to be upholding law and order in Bangladesh. They have lost all credibility to rule over the people of Bangladesh. They have destroyed Bangladesh and taken its population for a ride. The Prime Minister Hasina and her entire cabinet should be brought to the Hague for crimes against humanity.\n\nAjmal Masroor ( Human Rights Activists and Political Analysts) \n\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ajmal.masroor.7\/posts\/10151676204989439"}
