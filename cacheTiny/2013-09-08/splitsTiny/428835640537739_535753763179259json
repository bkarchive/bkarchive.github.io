Accused solders got freed from murder case in Indian court. Feelani was killed by Indian BSF's brutal bullet. This is Eye -Wash for BD people in the name of Justice.. becoz India think that Next Election is just to near So AWami League need Public support. India wanted to increase Public support for Awami and India in the name of so called Justice...Now We can think why we fought in 1971? We gave our lives for such kind of freedom? BD state power cannot give security its own Nationals ..so why this Freedom? Is false Freedom for BD nationals? who can Say? Why we fought and earned freedom from Pakistan? Why? To be under Indian arms? To give lives in the Indian hypocrite and coward bullets? And Awami Govt will not protest agisnt this verdict..Becoz Awami serves just purpose of Indian silent Conspiracy. Awami has no feelings for BD People.. its now clear.. Awami has feelings for Indian People.. And Indian Hindu People...So get down this Awami Govt loyal to Indian . Awami is getting down our Nation's confidence and our National moral values to Indian aggression..Is it Pre-planned?"}
