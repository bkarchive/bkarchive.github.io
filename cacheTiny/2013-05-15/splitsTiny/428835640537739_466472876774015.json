NASA\u2019s Terra and Aqua satellites recently captured visible and infrared imagery as the storm began to curve.\n\nNASA\u2019s Aqua satellite flew over Cyclone Mahasen on May 13 at 20:05 UTC (4:05 p.m. EDT) and the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instrument took the temperature of its cloud tops using infrared light. AIRS showed a large area of strong thunderstorms around the center of circulation where cloud top temperatures were as cold as -63 Fahrenheit (-52 Celsius). The heaviest thunderstorms remained over water and just skirted the southeastern coast of India.\n\nNASA\u2019s Terra satellite flew over Mahasen on May 14 at 05:35 UTC (1:35 a.m. EDT). The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument aboard Terra captured a visible image of the cyclone, revealing that it was a tightly wound, compact storm. Satellite imagery shows that strong convection has developed around the storm\u2019s center, visible in the MODIS image as high thunderstorm cloud tops that cast shadows on surrounding lower thunderstorms.\n\nOn May 14, Tropical Cyclone Mahasen continues moving through the Bay of Bengal. At 1500 UTC (11 a.m. EDT) Mahasen\u2019s center was near 15.1 north and 86.4 east, about 484 nautical miles (557 miles\/896 km) south-southeast of Kolkata, India. Mahasen was moving to the northeast at 7 knots (8 mph\/13 kph) and it had maximum sustained winds near 45 knots (51.7 mph\/83.3 kph).\n\nSea surface temperatures in the Bay of Bengal are warm enough to support a tropical cyclone. They are currently near 29 to 30 Celsius (84.2 to 86 Fahrenheit) along the forecast track toward Bangladesh. Vertical wind shear has also decreased, which will allow Mahasen to strengthen over the next couple of days.\n\nMahasen is forecast to intensify to 70 knots before making landfall near Chittagong, Bangladesh on Thursday, May 16.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.nasa.gov\/mission_pages\/hurricanes\/archives\/2013\/h2013_Mahasen.html"}
