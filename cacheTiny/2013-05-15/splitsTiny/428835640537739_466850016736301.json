The storm surge poses the greatest danger to residents of Bangladesh.\n\nNASA\u2019s Aqua satellite passed over Cyclone Mahasen on May 15 at 07:45 UTC (3:45 a.m. EDT) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument captured a visible image of the storm. The MODIS image showed that the storm has expanded over the last several days. In the MODIS image, strong, high thunderstorms are visible north and northeast of the center, as they cast shadows on surrounding storms that make up the cyclone."}
