He was stripped naked and beaten mercilessly by several officers at once. His fingertips were crushed with pliers. He is now paralysed waist down. Yet when Barrister Razzaq visited him in prison, he described how he had been tortured then smiled and said \"I am ready to be shahid\". These are the people of jannah inshaAllah."}
