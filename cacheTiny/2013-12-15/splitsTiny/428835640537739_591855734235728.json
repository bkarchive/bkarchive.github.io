But hundreds of thousand people all around the world are still mourning for Quader Mollah.Dhaka Central Jail authority was about to sentence his death on  11th Dec. But one of the reputed lawyer of Bangladesh Barrister Abdur  Razzak and his team stopped the sentence anyway that day.\n\nAuthority  denied his review petition against the verdict which is the violation  of human rights. Which is against the International Covenant on Civil  and Political Rights to which Bangladesh is a party. CNN reported that  Bangladesh hangs Islamist over UN objections. Not only CNN but other  world reputed medias also covered the contradiction of the verdict by  the Supreme Court of Bangladesh.\n\nAt last Abdul Quader Mollah was sentenced death on 12 Dec. Clashes, strikes were spread out all over the country.\n\nNoe why govt hanged Quader Mollah against UN, HRW and other important organizations objection?\nIf  you try to find the answer, you will get that was a judicial murder.  International Crime Tribunal (ICT) and supreme court of Bangladesh is  politically biased. And they are serving the govt interest violating  laws and order.\n\nToday i dont want to talk about the  contradictions of the verdict rather i want to let the world know how  Bangladeshi people react over this historical miscarriage by Bangladesh  Govt.\n\nHundreds of thousand people prayed Gayebana  Janaza (Special Prayer for dead) all over the world. The love, respect,  honor he got was historic. This also proves that he was not a criminal.  He was popular politician of Bangladesh.\n\nIt should  not be compared but this issue also comes now. About 20 people attended  in the funeral of father of nation Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. People of  Bangladesh sighed of relief after Mujib's death.\n\nHis party awami league hanged a better politician Quader Mollah. A lot of people are still mourning for him."}
