His statement is given below:\nThe government has murdered Martyr Abdul Quader Molla intentionally on 12th December night. Just 26 hour after the incident, as per the government\u2019s instruction, the law enforcers forcefully entered into the house of popular and socially established leader of Lakhipur district Jamaat Dr. Fayez Ahmed. They ransacked and searched the house. At one stage, they took Dr. Fayez Ahmed in the rooftop and threw him in the ground after firing bullet on him. The government is killing Jamaat leaders\u2019 one after one in a bid to make the party leaderless. In Kompaniganj Upazila under Noakhali district, law enforcers opened fire upon protesters of Jamaat-e-Islami that killed Jamaat activists Russel, Shibir man Saiful Islam, Matiur Rahman, Mohammad Raihan and Shajib and wounded 50 others. Off them several are critically injured. I am condemning and protesting all these incidents of heinous murder.\nAs per the government\u2019s instruction, in last 30 days 88 people had been killed by the law enforcers. This government is a killer authority. I am calling upon the countrymen to mobilize their ongoing peaceful movement against this autocratic government.\nI am urging the nation to observe nationwide dawn to dusk strike on 15th December against the government sponsored atrocities and to observe the Victory Day on 16th December."}
