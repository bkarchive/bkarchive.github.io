That man who was shot was my brother, that lady who was killed is my sister. That young girl who lost her life is my little sister and that little boy who was murdered is my younger brother.\nNot any of my business? Please, go check your morals.\nThis isn't about MB. This isn't about politics. It's abut cold blooded murder.\nSo don't sit there and justify the actions of Sisi and SCAF because of your anti MB stance, tbh I couldn't give a hoo ha what you think about MB. Give the dead some respect and have some shame.\nNot any of the worlds business? What has humanity come to!\n\nZara Kadir (Fan Post)"}
