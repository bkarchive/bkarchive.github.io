They are being oppressed by a tyrant regime - hundreds were brutally killed, thousands were injured! So many have lost their loved ones: mums, dads, brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, and the list goes on... Don't forget the Ummah - the one body - when part is unwell, the whole body feels the pain! Please pray for them. Pray for their freedom. Pray for peace in Egypt. That's the least we can do.\n\nFan Post"}
