So, the next general election must be held under a non-party caretaker government.\u201d\r\n \r\nHe urged the government to take immediate measures to reinstate the caretaker system in the constitution.\r\n \r\nBNP standing committee members Tariqul Islam, MK Anwar, ASM Hannan Shah, Mirza Abbas, Nazrul Islam Khan and Goyeshwar Chandra Roy were, among others, present.","picture":"http:\/\/photos-d.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-ash4\/1044781_500364180051551_1314750383_s.jpg"}
