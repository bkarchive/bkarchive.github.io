Demand that the government end forthwith all killing, violence and terrorization against the Muslims in Burma\/Myanmar and ensure full religious freedom with their security of life, property and dignity;\r\n2. Also demand that the government stop spreading of such pre-planned violence against Muslims in other places of Burma;\r\n3. Request the international community, United Nations, Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), Governments of United States, United Kingdoms and their western allies, European Union, Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and neighboring countries to put pressure on Burma and exert concerted efforts to protect and save the Muslim community in Burma;\r\n4. Rapid lifting or suspension of sanctions on Burma is premature in this stage; and request to reinstate sanctions in order to protect the Rohingya and other minorities, promote human rights and inclusive democratic and political reforms in Burma;\r\n5. To replace Burma Citizenship Law of 1982 with a new law that conform to international law standards and ensure citizenship rights of Muslims in Burma;\r\n6. Request to conduct a UN independent inquiry and bring the perpetrators before justice.\r\n7. Request for assistance and cooperation from international community to ensure fundamental rights of Muslims in Burma.","picture":"http:\/\/photos-h.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-prn1\/t1\/524224_439869842767652_772378407_s.jpg"}
