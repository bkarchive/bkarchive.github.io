Throwing a shoe at someone is an especially potent insult in Muslim countries because the sole is considered unclean.\r\n\r\nLocal TV channels showed video of the incident, but it was impossible to identify the shoe thrower because he was hidden behind part of the corridor.\r\n\r\nFollowing the incident, judges granted Musharraf an extension of pre-emptive bail in three cases against him, meaning he cannot be immediately arrested.\r\n\r\nTwo of the cases involve the 2007 assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and the killing of Akbar Bugti, a Baloch nationalist leader who died in August 2006 after a standoff with the Pakistani military. Musharraf was granted an extension of 21 days in those two cases.\r\n\r\nHe was granted a 15-day extension in connection with a third case, in which he is accused of illegally removing a number of judges at the time, including the Supreme Court chief justice, said Shahadat Awan, the prosecutor general for surrounding Sindh province.\r\n\r\nMusharraf was also restricted from leaving the country during the period that his bail was extended, Pakistani state TV reported. Musharraf returned from exile last Sunday, seeking a possible political comeback despite the legal charges against him and death threats from Taliban militants.\r\n\r\nIn Karachi, a group of lawyers protested outside the Sindh High Court on Friday as Musharraf entered. They chanted slogans against the former military strongman and jostled with his supporters. \u2014AP\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.saudigazette.com.sa\/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&contentid=20130330159132","picture":"http:\/\/photos-e.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-frc1\/581618_440223162732320_573219056_s.jpg"}
