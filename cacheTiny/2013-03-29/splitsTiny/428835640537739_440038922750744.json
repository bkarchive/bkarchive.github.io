The government also on March 3 filed an appeal against acquittal of Quader Molla of the charge of Keraniganj mass killing and sought his death sentence.\nJamaat leader Delwar Hossain Sayedee on Thursday filed an appeal against his death sentence pronounced by the International Crimes Tribunal 1 on February 28 on charge of crimes against humanity committed 1971.\nOf the four judges, Justice Anwarul Haque is the most senior judge currently in the High Court.  Justice Siddiqur Rahman ranks fifth, Justice Hasan Foez Siddique 41st and Justice Shamsuddin Choudhury 42nd in the hierarchy.Justice Siddiqur Rahman will retire in two months time.\n\nOutgoing Supreme Court Bar Association president Zainul Abedin on Thursday told New Age that he would give his reaction on the appointments soon after consulting the newly elected executive committee.He, however, said that the appointments would create chaos in the Supreme Court as three judges were elevated to the Appellate Division superseding their seniors.\u2018It will also frustrate the superseded judges,\u2019 Zainul said, adding that such frustrations would hamper their judicial activities.\n\nEarlier on March 19, Jatiyatabadi Ainjibi Forum, a platform of the pro-Bangladesh Nationalist Party lawyers, urged the chief justice to stop elevation of any \u2018controversial\u2019 High Court judge to the Appellate Division superseding senior judges.The forum was opposing elevation of Justice Shamsuddin specially to the Appellate Division branding him as \u2018controversial.\u2019The controversy arose when on June 5, 2012 the High bench led by Justice Shamsuddin had termed \u2018seditious\u2019 speaker Abdul Hamid\u2019s remarks in parliament on May 29, 2012 about the High Court\u2019s decision to relocate the Roads and Highways Department elsewhere.Abdul Hamid, now the acting president, in his ruling on June 18, 2012 accused Justice Shamsuddin Choudhury of violating the constitution by making \u2018discourteous\u2019 remarks about the speaker and the parliament.In his ruling, the speaker had also requested the chief justice to take suitable action against the judge for violating the constitution.\nWe are unhappy at such unprecedented super-session.The 42nsd  in seniority among High Court Judges Mr Shamsuddin has been appointed superseding about forty judges.Another with 41st seniority has been appointed superseding similar number.\nWe are surprised at the elevation of Justice Shamsuddin Manik who had been so controversial.There had been demand many times to refer his case to supreme judicial council but nothing was done by the last President.It is more surprising that present Acting President Mr Abdul Hamid  who had accused Mr Shamsuddin as violating the constitution has been approved by him for elevation.The appointments largely show bias which is not good for the country."}
