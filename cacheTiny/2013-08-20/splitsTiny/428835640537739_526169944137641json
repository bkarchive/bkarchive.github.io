You have lived as a silent seeker of new horizons to rebuild this nation to assume its place among civilizations.\r\n\r\nYou never occupied yourself with what preoccupies those of your age. Even though traditional studies failed to fulfil your aspirations and interest; you have always been the first in your class.\r\n\r\nI have not had enough of your precious company in this short life, especially that my time did not allow me to enjoy your companionship. The last time we sat together at Rabaa Al Adawiya square you asked me \"even when you are with us you are busy\" and I told you \"it seems that this life will not be enough to enjoy each other's company so I pray to God that we enjoy our companionship in paradise.\"\r\n\r\nTwo nights before you were murdered I saw you in my dream in a white wedding dress and you were an icon of beauty. When you lay next to me I asked you \"Is it your wedding night?\" You answered, \"It is in the noon not the evening\". When they told me you were murdered on Wednesday afternoon I understood what you meant and I knew God had accepted your soul as a martyr. You strengthened my belief that we are on the truth and our enemy is on falsehood.\r\n\r\nIt caused me severe pain not to be at your last farewell and see you for the last time; not to kiss your forehead; and not be honoured to lead your funeral prayer. I swear to God, my darling I was not afraid for my life or from an unjust prison, but I wanted to carry the message you scarified your soul for; to complete the revolution, to win and achieve its objectives.\r\n\r\nYour soul has been elevated with your head held high resisting the tyrants. The treacherous bullets have hit you in the chest. What spectacularly determined and pure soul. I am confident that you were honest to God and He has chosen you among us to honour you with sacrifice.\r\n\r\nFinally, my beloved daughter and dignified teacher:\r\n\r\nI do not say goodbye, but I say farewell. We shall meet soon with our beloved Prophet and his companions in Heaven where our wish to enjoy each other's company and our loved ones' company will come true.\r\n\r\n- See more at: http:\/\/www.middleeastmonitor.com\/news\/africa\/7007-letter-from-dr-mohamed-beltaji-to-his-martyred-daughter#sthash.KRcowd4b.dpuf","picture":"https:\/\/scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ash3\/565028_526169924137643_160732794_s.jpg"}
