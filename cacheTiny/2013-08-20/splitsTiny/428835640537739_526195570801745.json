Musharraf Hossain, cabinet secretary said.\r\nThe cabinet had also asked the ICT ministry to bring further changes in the law, after reviewing the proposed amendment, Hossain added. \r\nAn ordinanace will also be promulgated soon, the cabinet secretary said. \u201cThe objective of the law is to protect and control the misuse of information technologies,\u201d he said.\r\nLaw inadequate in dealing with cybercrime\r\nHowever, industry watchers have expressed concern that the law is unable to curb cybercrime in the country.\r\nMustafa Jabbar, president of Bangladesh Computer Samity, said many cybercrimes or digital crimes did not fall under the purview of the law. For example, the law did not address any crime committed through using mobile phones.\r\nThe law also considers e-mails as evidence, which conflicts with the country\u2019s Evidence Act which does not recognize e-mails as evidence, but the amendments did not address these issues, Jabbar noted.\r\n\u201cThe law offers the scope for political misuse. There is no guarantee that the police will not misuse it,\u201d he said.\r\nFahim Mashroor, president of IT trade body Bangladesh Association of Software and Information Services, also agreed the law was vulnerable to misuse due to empowering the law enforcers to arrest anyone without warrants. The government should have consulted the relevant quarters before the amendments, Mashroor added\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/bdinn.com\/news\/38714\/","picture":"http:\/\/photos-h.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-frc1\/995474_526195564135079_819430099_s.jpg"}
