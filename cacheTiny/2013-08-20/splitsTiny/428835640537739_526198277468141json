He also said, the investigating agency would submit formal charges against the party before the war crimes tribunal on completion of probe.\r\nA total of 10 top leaders of Jamaat-e-Islami, which sided with the Pakistan army as a political party to resist the Bangladesh\u2019s independence from Pakistan, are now facing trials in the two war crimes tribunals. Five of them have already been convicted of crimes against humanity and genocide and sentenced either to death or imprisonment for life-time and 90 years.\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/bdinn.com\/news\/probe-under-way-for-alleged-war-crimes-by-the-jamaat\/","picture":"https:\/\/fbcdn-photos-e-a.akamaihd.net\/hphotos-ak-ash3\/1157579_526198260801476_364097101_s.png"}
