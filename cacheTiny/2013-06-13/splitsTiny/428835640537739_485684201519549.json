BNP and India are courting each other for different reason: One of them to go into power, and other to have influence in the next prospective government. This may be a reason for Ershad\u2019s recent travel plan to Singapore where it is thought he will meet with Begum Khalida Zia to discuss the matter further. It is also reported that Shamser Mobin choudhury has visited India to improve their relationship with powerful neighbour after a dip in inter-personal relationship with Begum Zia.\r\n\r\nBut, to counter this new marriage, we are hearing numbers of high profile VIP are visiting USA including the Army chief. This could be a normal visit, or could be a counter step by the increasingly unpopular Awamileague. Todays Inu -minus threat to minus Khalida Zia could turn out to a premature wishful thinking. Different forces are in play, and hopefully by October we may have a clue as to the direction the country is heading towards.","picture":"http:\/\/photos-g.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-prn1\/1013702_485684194852883_808091820_s.jpg"}
