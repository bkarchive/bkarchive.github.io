Those oppressed and suppressed grew fit to burst with fury against the current regime.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe said so while chairing the monthly Secretariat Meeting of Chhatrashibir held this afternoon at 4:00 pm at Shahid Abdul Malek Auditorium in the capital city. Moreover, Shibir\u2019s Central Office Secretary Atiqur Rahman, Publicity Secretary Abu Saleh Md. Yahya and Publication Secretary Mizanur Rahman were present at the meeting.\r\n\r\nShibir Secretary-General said, \u201cThe Awami government transformed the countrymen into its foes. This government frequently tried to hang on power by opening fire at the people whenever they attempted their protests. This way, the government is going on with its killing mission one after another. But such daydream of hanging on power by killing people shall never come true. The people will return home only after this government is ousted.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe urged the student segment to go on with the ongoing protests and movement ceaselessly.\r\n\r\n-Fan Page,\r\nBANGLADESH ISLAMI CHHATRASHIBIR","picture":"http:\/\/photos-a.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-prn1\/t1\/994033_566985910056044_1335547614_s.jpg"}
