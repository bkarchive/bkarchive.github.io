Wayne, Adil, and Russ were in Cairo covering events.\r\n\r\nThe arrests follow the detainment of Abdullah al-Shami who was performing his duties as an Al Jazeera correspondent when he was arrested after the raid of the pro-Morsi sit-in at Rabaa al-Adawiya on August 14, along with Mohamed Badr, a cameraman for Al Jazeera Mubasher Misr who has been held for more than one month.\r\n\r\nThese arrests are part of what Reporters Without Borders has called \"growing hostility\" towards journalists in Egypt.\r\n\r\nThere has also been a campaign against Al Jazeera in particular, as the channel's offices were raided last month and security forces seized equipment which has yet to be returned.\r\n\r\nAl Jazeera calls for the Egyptian authorities to release all our staff unconditionally along with their belongings and equipment.\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/pressoffice\/2013\/08\/2013829152334989736.html","picture":"https:\/\/fbcdn-photos-f-a.akamaihd.net\/hphotos-ak-prn2\/1173832_531129740308328_867101013_s.jpg"}
