Slightly injured Reshma had even taken treatment from a hospital in Savar. Newspaper, Amar Desh, was informed of this by a lineman of New Wave Style Garments, which was housed in the building and was the factory where Reshma worked also. The lineman, Enamul, is a close colleague of Reshma who had also come out of the rubble with her on the first day.\r\n\r\nThroughout Bangladesh doubts had been cast upon the story of Reshma, who was said to have survived on 4 biscuits and a bottle of water, and was also seen to have been rescued in completely new and fresh clothes. Amardesh went on to investigate the facts behind the story.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/progressbangladesh.com\/rana-plaza-tragedy-the-drama-of-reshmas-miraculous-rescue\/","picture":"http:\/\/photos-d.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-ash3\/1044329_492455167509119_88963112_s.jpg"}
