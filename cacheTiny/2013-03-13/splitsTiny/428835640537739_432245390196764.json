That is why Awami League makes a political pact with Jamaat when it suits them and then wants to keep them quiet by inflicting pressure on them\u201d.\n\n\u201cSheikh Hasina made a pact with Pakistan like Sheikh Mujib did in 1973. That is why the tribunal to try war criminals, \u201cInternational War Crimes Tribunal\u201d was changed and renamed the \u201cInternational Crimes Tribunal\u201d to try crimes against humanity\u201d, said Badruddin Umar.\n\nBadruddin Umar made these comments in the afternoon of Tuesday 5 March at Paltan\u2019s Liberation Building at a seminar convened by four left wing parties on \u201cTrying war criminals, Jamaat and Shibir\u2019s country-wide anarchy, state sponsored terrorism and massacre and the question of governance by the people.\u201d\n\nBadruddin elaborated his statement by adding, \u201cSheikh Mujid said in 1973 that \u2018Bangalee knows how to forgive\u2019 and forgave 195 known war criminals by making a pact with Julfikar Ali Bhutto. The injustice that he left behind has transformed taken a dangerous shape now.\u201d\n\nBadruddin added, \u201cIn keeping with the example set by Sheikh Mujib, Sheikh Hasina made a deal with Jamaat in 1986 and participated in the election under Ershad. Awami League betrayed Jahanara Imam\u2019s 1992 verdict of Gono-Adalot (People\u2019s Court) by initiating political activities with Jamaat from the same stage in 1994. After coming into power in 1996, Awami League gave Jamaat two parliamentary seats reserved for women as a thank you.\u201d\n\nRegarding the Shahbag movement, Badruddin Umar said, \u201cShahbag\u2019s youth initially rose up against the government\u2019s secret pact with Jamaat and it was a credible movement. However, Awami League assumed full control of the movement later and it became weak and restricted within the government\u2019s parameters. Now, the unpopular Awami League are trying to win votes by exploiting the Shahbag movement.\u201d\n\nBadruddin Umar said, \u201cShahbag\u2019s youth need to understand that those who came to power in the last 42 years did not try war criminals for their own political gain; Awami League will also not be different.\u201d\n\nThe chairman of Jatiyo Gono-Front, left wing leader, Tipu Biswas said, \u201cBringing to justice Pakistani army personnel and their collaborators from Bangladesh, Rajakar, Al-Badr and Al-Shams and giving them due punishment was the demand of the people of this country. And the ruling Awami League party turned a blind eye to this demand in 1972.\u201d\n\nTipu Biswas said, \u201cIn 1973, Awami League allowed 93,000 Pakistani army personnel and 95 known war criminals to be repatriated to Pakistan without bringing them to justice. They also gave a general amnesty to the likes of Rajakar and Al-Badr without any qualms. Now, this unpopular government wants to use this issue to overcome the next election.\u201d\n\nThe co-chairman of new Democratic Gono-Morcha, Saifuzzaman Dudu said, \u201cShahbag has now turned into a picnic spot. Who goes to Shahbag and who controls this movement? Who did they start this movement against? Now who is the movement targeted at? There was a public outcry and that is why there was a huge public support at the beginning. Now Shahbag\u2019s position has become clear. They have turned into an excuse for the government.\u201d\n\nDudu also said, \u201cWhat kind of movement is this when it is safeguarded by the government, given cold water to drink and three meals a day? They would understand what real movement is if they got hit by pepper spray and beaten up by the police. Who is the Shahbag movement against? Who are they appealing to with their demands? If their movement is against the government, why is the government providing them with protection? Actually, the net gainers of Shahag are the 14-party alliance and Awami League.\u201d\n\nLeader of UPDF, Michael Chakma said, \u201cwhen slogan is given at Shahbag \u2013 \u2018Who are you and who am I? Bangalee, Bangalee!\u2019 This hurts our sentiments very much, because we are not Bangalees, we are part of Bangladesh\u2019s small ethnic minorities\u201d.\n\nChaired by the convenor of National Democratic Gono-Moncho, Masud Khan and hosted by the general secretary of Jatiyo Mukti Council, Faizul Hakim, also were present political science expert Hasan Fakri and general secretary of National Writers Forum, Hasibur Rahman."}
