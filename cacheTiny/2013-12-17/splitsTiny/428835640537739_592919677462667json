The leaders of all political parties, including Jamaat-i-Islami and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, should keep supporters from engaging in violence.  \n\nThe government should set up an independent commission to carry out prompt, effective, and impartial investigations into the violence and hold all those responsible to account.\n\nSecurity forces appear to have stepped up operations against the opposition in recent days.

Media reports say that security forces have killed at least 20 opposition members during clashes and have arrested many more.\nsee more: http:\/\/www.hrw.org\/news\/2013\/12\/16\/bangladesh-end-deadly-street-violence"}
