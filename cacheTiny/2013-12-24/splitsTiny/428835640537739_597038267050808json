The circumstances are such that upon visit one might be driven to think that earthquake had taken a toll on the locality. One has to see to believe; places caught on fire, the air thick with hue and cry of the local people.\r\n\r\nThe people are moonstruck losing their belongings; their clamoring have given the place an ill face. Thousands of people have lost their home; their sole refuge. Just at the sight of the joint forces people start running. Even the women, child and elderly were not left out.  During nightfall younger people are trying to escape to safe places.\r\n\r\nArson attacks are taking place every night. Arson and looting of houses taking place every now and then.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s more trouble to it. During the tenure of the current government, 216 cases were filed against the Jamaat-Shibir, BNP and its sister party leaders-activists on various occasions. In these cases 4500 leaders-activists were charged as convicts. Plus 73,977 more were marked as unidentified convicts. 1,449 leaders-activists were arrested following these cases.\r\n\r\nThe people of Satkhira have become completely helpless losing their last refuge giving in to the ravages by the joint forces and the Awami party activists from 16 December to 19 December.\r\n \r\nOn one hand they are living the life of a fugitive on the other they are impoverished losing their homes and occupations now living under the open sky in this cold winter with their family with every reason to feel insecure.\r\n \r\nEven their relatives are not being able to reach them, nobody to help them with food. Many had to face the wrath of the police and Awami cadres trying to find the whereabouts of their bloodlines. On the whole the protectors have taken the role of the spoiler in this border district of the country.\r\n\r\nEven the human rights activists can\u2019t contain the images of torture and repression. And the journalists do not dare to manifest the actual scene of the country for the lack of security of their lives.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFact findings suggest that Satkhira, which is a coastal area, was affected by the cyclone Aila on 25 May, 2009. Gabura of Shyamnagar and Padmapukur union were wrecked by the cyclone. The people of the locality are living a poor life following the aftereffects of the cyclone.\r\n \r\nBefore the people could recover from the damages they have been afflicted by the rampage of the joint forces and the Awami party cadres and activists. Since the night of last 15 December, 57 have been held up following the operations in different upazillas who all happen to be leaders or activists of BNP, Jamaat-Shibir. During the expedition 7 have been killed including Jahangir Morol, Saheb, Babu of Jamaat.\r\n\r\nSatkhira district Jamaat amir former MP Principal Mawlana Abdul Khaleq and over hundred more leaders-activists of BNP and Jamaat had their homes destroyed by bulldozer and burnt down.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn the last 11 months 33 leaders-activists of BNP-Jamaat and 27 of Awami League had been murdered. In order to avenge the murders the followers of Awami League had unleashed destruction in different areas of the district.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRecently, people of 7 upazillas took to the street to observe all the programmes announced by 18-party alliance. They were determined to make the blockades a success separating Shyamnagar, Kaliganj, Debhata, Ashashuni, Tala and Kalarowa from the town district.\r\n\r\n As a result, the government ordered the joint forces to perform operations in this area. Azizur Rahman, the district publicity secretary of Jamaat claimed that these raids were conducted to wipe out Jamaat-Shibir activists from the area.\r\n\r\n The local people complained that the Awami party cadres have continued their rampage in the area along with the police torture on BNP leaders-activists.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Awami League party leaders were forced to leave certain areas by the protest of the people.  They are not taking part in the attacks on BNP-Jamaat-Shibir with joint forces. Even the Jubo League and Chatro League are sometimes seen carrying arms of the police who are regarded as their accomplice in these operations.\r\n\r\nSatkhira district publicity secretary of Jamaat informs that 216 cases were filed against them during the tenure of the current government. 4,500 were enlisted in these cases and 73,977 unknown people were convicted. 1,449 leaders-activists have been arrested and 282 are in jail.\r\n \r\nThe people of the locality informed that from Tuesday evening to Wednesday morning 5 shops of hindu owners were burned down by Awami League cadres including Jagdish, Tapos, Biswanath, Indrajit in Choumuhoni, Mokundpur, Faridpur, Shreedhorkathi, Hogla villages of Bishnupur union of Kaliganj upazilla and Gobindpur, Vodrokhali village of Kushliya union. The damage is worth TK20 crore, said the families of the victims. During the arson attack brigade was not allowed to enter the area.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBesides, in Bisnupur union 12 homes and 27 shops, and in Kushalia union 19 homes and business units were burned down and looted.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the OC of Kaliganj Thana Azom Khan was asked about the shop ransacking and arson of last night he said, \u201cIt was the doing of Jamaat-Shibir. That\u2019s why the enraged public are burning their houses. What can we do about it?\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to reports, 10 were injured including an OC and a constable in a conflict between the joint forces and Jamaat-Shibir in Gorer Math village of Kushlia union of Kaliganj upazilla in Satkhira.\r\n\r\nThe Kaliganj thana OC Ali Azam said that the joint forces had initiated their operation after 22 December noon to catch the suspect of the murder of Awami League Bishnupur union chairman Moslem Uddin.\r\n\r\nAt one point when they reached Gorer Math they were faced by the picketing of Jamaat-Shibir activists. In reply when the joint forces started shooting a Shibir cadre was shot and taken to the hospital by the police.\r\n\r\nOC Ali Azam and police member Shariful Islam also got injured by bricks in the process. But the local people dismissed his claims remarking them as hilarious.\r\n\r\nThey claimed that in the name of operation the joint forces joining in hands with Awami party cadres ransacked the houses of innocent people. They also assaulted many innocent persons.\r\n\r\nEven the housewives couldn\u2019t escape their beating. Following these events the local people built a resistance against them. They started throwing bricks. The joint forces tried to dismantle them by shooting at them.\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.english.rtnn.net\/\/newsdetail\/detail\/1\/4\/56543#.Urkyk86me_I","picture":"https:\/\/fbcdn-photos-h-a.akamaihd.net\/hphotos-ak-frc1\/486697_597038140384154_710661492_s.jpg"}
