In this effort, to demonize Bangladeshis as a fundamentalist country, the Awamis led by Hasina began discrediting Islam (the only obstacle for India to Bhutanize Bangladesh)  by bringing the JI out in the open through framing the \"war crimes trial\" with phony witnesses.\r\n\r\nIn serving India, Hasina has already committed three dangerous and notable crimes of massacres:\r\n\r\n(1) Pilkhana massacre\r\n(2) Baitul Mokarram massacre\r\n(3) Shapla Chottor massacre\r\n\r\nIn her attempt for a closure about the 1971 war, she has committed these events of crimes against humanity. Now, for a closure of the trio massacres, is it going to be the beginning of a new trial for her and her team of killers? True, the nation awaits to see a trial against Hasina for her fascist BKSALI actions of murder, and anti state India love directed against the sovereign state of Bangladesh?","picture":"http:\/\/photos-d.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-frc3\/1477815_596825413738760_656831504_s.jpg"}
