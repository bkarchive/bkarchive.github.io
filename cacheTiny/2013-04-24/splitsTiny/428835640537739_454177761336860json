You are not immune and gonna face trial by a Superb Judge...!!\n\nIsn\u2019t Allah the Wisest of all the judges? [Holy Quran- 95:8]\n\nSo, the judges who are discharging judicial functions today have a big reason to worry for, one day, they must stand the trial before Allah who is the \u2018Judge\u2019 of all the judges and the Wisest of them all. If thousands of guilty men are left unpunished for lack of proper evidence of their guilt, judges will not be held liable for this and the guilty are sure to be brought to book by Allah in the afterlife. But, if a single innocent man is punished wrongly and done injustice to by any biased judge, the judge must stand on the dock before Allah in the afterlife and the aggrieved innocent will be a plaintiff against the judge in Allah\u2019s court. That day, Allah will do \u2018complete justice\u2019 to all and sundry, especially to all the parties in dispute. This is why, apart from public accountability, judges must, in essence, question themselves as to whether they are fair and just while dealing with any legal or paralegal dispute; otherwise, they have every possibility of being endangered in the hereafter. Allah says:\n\n\u201cAnd they will not be able to escape therefrom (from the Day of Judgment)\u201d [82:16]\n\nSo, we all are willy-nilly bound to attend the trial procedure of Allah, the Most Just, in the world after this world.\n\nAllah loves those who are fair and just [49:9]. So, let\u2019s be \u2018EXTREMELY JUST\u2019 while dealing with others even if they are our enemies.\n\n(ami.hobo.vorerpakhi)"}
