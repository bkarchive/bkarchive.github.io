IN SHA ALLAH - If I ever open a business in Bangladesh which I am planning to, I will not hire a BRAC University graduate until they change their stupid dress code. Please note - this is not my expression of hatred and unjust to those graduate or something like that. This is my ban on this ridiculous university and anything related to it. Today they have introduced \u201cDress Code\u201d tomorrow may be something else! Please stop them now, clearly things are going out of control. My request to all Bangladeshi Muslim parents - please stop sending your children to BRAC University. We are scared. We don\u2019t want a \u201cBRAC University\u201d factory that will produce more \u201cOishe\u201d. We already had enough.\n\nBy Brother Hossain."}
