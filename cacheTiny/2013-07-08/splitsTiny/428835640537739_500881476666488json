His blood pressure was 60 over 30, which was very low and we don't have blood transfusion facilities here, we're trying to cope but a lot of the injuries are severe and had to be forwarded to the main hospitals. There were a lot of shots to the head - more than seven people were shot in the eye. Ambulances were able to get in but we didn't have enough ambulances, around three to four, we needed to transport 500 people. We had to stack patients here and make a priority. \r\n\r\n    Dr El-Hassa Ahmed, Qasr al Aini, emergency doctor manning field hospital.","picture":"https:\/\/fbcdn-photos-h-a.akamaihd.net\/hphotos-ak-frc3\/998714_500881456666490_1258896165_s.jpg"}
