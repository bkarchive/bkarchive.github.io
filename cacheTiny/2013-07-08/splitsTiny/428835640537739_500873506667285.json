This reminds me of Zionist and American strategy to use the secularist and the army to silence any form of Islamic movement taking momentum in the modern world. We Muslim are apathetic to the root cause of our problem of political and social instability. Our main enemy are those outside conspirators who take every opportunity to divide our people so that they could benefit from the instability. Civil war in Egypt can not be good for any party in Egypt. If we have any sense of belonging to a Muslim identity, then we must fight those enemy\u2019s who always had been a dividing factor in all Muslim country. It is time we Muslim take imitative to unite under one common goal, that is to say no to outside interference, have an independent foreign and economic policy, resolve our differences, and work together for a strong ,prosperous and god fearing Ummah.\n\n(\u09ab\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u09a8 \u09aa\u09cb\u09b8\u09cd\u099f)"}
