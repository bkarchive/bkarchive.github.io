But at this moment when I can see almost all the journalists and intellectuals are talking lie against Jamaat than I feel I need to tell the truth. After talking with several people of several places I came to know that terrorism is being done by AL just to blame Jamaat. Moreover, after studying a lot and analyzing the current attitude of India I am convinced that 1971 war was created by India and it was a RAW project. AL and media are talking against Jamaat because Jamaat is the only organized force which can counter the Indian hegemony. The enemy of our independence in 1971 is turned to be best protector of our independence. So despite my disaproval to Jamaat politics I feel this party need to be exists as a safegurd of our independence. India has purchased our journalists, politicians, writers and army but failed to purchase Jamaat."}
