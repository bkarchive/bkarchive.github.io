In this regard, Jamaat-e-Islami respectfully reminds the European Parliament that it is the democratic right of all political parties to choose its coalition partners and any call to challenge such a democratic is improper.\u2019\nMentioning that Jamaat-e-Islami is a democratic political party and recognizes the right of all political parties and movements to espouse its own political ideology the statement condemned the characterization in EU resolution that Jamaat-e-Islami and Hefazet-e-Islam are responsible for the violence and are undemocratic forces.\nRegarding EU resolution linking Jamaat and its allies with the post-election violence specifically directed against minority groups the Jamaat leader demanded that there is no evidence to link Jamaat-e-Islami or its student body to these crimes.\n\u2018Such unsubstantiated attacks on Jamaat-e-Islami, in the absence of any compelling evidence, are inappropriate and likely to further contribute to the flow of violence.\u2019\n\u2018On the contrary, there are credible allegations to suggest that such attacks may have been conducted by Government Forces and therefore an independent investigation is essential.\u2019\nIn this regard statement reminded that, \u2018on 9 January 2014 Jamaat-e-Islami called upon the United Nations to form an independent commission of inquiry to investigate post-election violence specifically directed against minority groups\u2019.\nHowever Jamaat in its statement appreciated the attempts by the Members of the Alliance for Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) Group for their calls to reform the Bangladesh Central Election Commission and to hold fresh elections under a neutral transitional government.\nIn the statement Jamaat appreciated the European Parliament for calling for a moratorium on the death penalty, particularly in relation to the International Crimes Tribunal and call on the Bangladesh Government for a moratorium on the death penalty.\n\nFull text of the statement:\nhttp:\/\/bdinn.com\/from-the-press\/41196\/"}
