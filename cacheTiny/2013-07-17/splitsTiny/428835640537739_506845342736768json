The government has been being severely detached from public sympathy due to its continuous failure to run the state. The government is about to collapse in a heap. In such circumstances, the government has finalized to unjustly punish Ali Ahsan Muhammad Mujahid under the so-called war crimes trial with an aim to escape public wrath. They are not letting the countrymen live in peace even in a glorified month like Ramadan.\n\nThis is why we\u2019d like to call dawn-to-dusk shutdown on 17th July tomorrow protesting against the government conspiracy of victimizing top Jamaat leader Ali Ahsan Muhammad Mujahid."}
