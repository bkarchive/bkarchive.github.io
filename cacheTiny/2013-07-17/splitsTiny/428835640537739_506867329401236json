Fromthe early 1960sJamaat was active against allthe autocratic governments.\nThe Awami League wasin powerfortwo terms:from1972\u20101975 and 1996\u20102001.During these\ntwo termsthey took no step whatsoeverforthe trial ofthe leaders ofJamaat\u2010e\u2010Islami on the\nallegation ofthe so\u2010called war crime.During themassmovementforrestoration of democracy\nin the 1980s and during themovementfor CaretakerGovernmentin the 1990s,the Awami\nLeague had no difficulty in working side by side with Jamaatleaders. A person is presumed\ninnocent until he is proven guilty. Itisreally surprising that when the leadership ofJamaat was\nnotlisted among the 195 who were to be tried for war crimes,they have now been termed as\nwar criminals. Thisis a violation the fundamentalrights and human rights ofthe Jamaatleaders.\nJamaat\u2010e\u2010Islami and Constitutionalism\nJamaat\u2010e\u2010Islami (\u201cJamaat\u201d)is one ofthe oldest partiesin the sub\u2010continent. It was organised in\nBritish India in 1941.Jamaatstarted its work in whatis now Bangladesh in the 1950s.Jamaat\u2010e\u2010\nIslami is amoderate Islamic political party that believesin democracy, human rights and is\ncommitted to upholding the rule oflaw.Jamaat wantsto establish an justsociety through\ndemocratic process and democratic process only. Because in Islamno one hasthe rightto lead\nunless he orshe is an elected representative ofthe people. Thisis precisely the reason why in\nmore than half a century ofits existence Jamaat hasfollowed the democratic path only. It has\nparticipated in almost allthe national and local elections. To attain its objectives,Jamaat has\nneverresorted to violence or unconstitutionalmeans. It has always abided by the laws ofthe\ncountry and in the face of extreme provocation and politicalrepression pursued itsrightthrough\nlegalmeans. For example, in January 1964 Jamaat was outlawed by the then government of\nPakistan. The decision ofthe government was challenged and finally,the Supreme Court of\nPakistan presided over by the then ChiefJustice A.R. Cornelius declared the government\u2019s action\nof outlawing Jamaat unlawful[See: Sayiid Abul A\u2019la Mawdudi andOthers Vs TheGovt. of West\nPakistan andOthers, 17Dhaka Law Report, Supreme Court, Page 209]. Similarly in 1973,the\nGovernment, by a notification disqualified ProfessorGolamAzam, former Ameer ofJamaat,\nfrombeing a citizen of Bangladesh. 22 yearslater ProfessorGolamAzamchallenged the order of\nthe government before theHigh Court, and both theHigh CourtDivision and the Appellate\nDivision ofthe Supreme Court of Bangladesh declared the government\u2019s decision as unlawful.Thus ProfessorGolamAzamobtained his birth right of citizenship through court oflaw.[See\nProfessorGolamAzamVs. Bangladesh (45Dhaka Law Report,High CourtDivision, page 433 and\nBangladesh Vs. ProfessorGolamAzam, 46Dhaka Law Report, AppellateDivision, page 192].\nJamaat\u2019s participation in the democraticmovements\nFromthe early 1960sJamaat,together with other political parties, was active againstthe\nautocratic government of Ayub Khan.Jamaat was atthe fore front offorming Pakistan\nDemocratic Movement(PDM), CombinedOpposition Parties(COP) and later onDemocratic\nAction Committee (DAC),three platforms of allthe political parties which fought againstthe\nautocratic regime of Ayub Khan. The Awami League was also an active component of COP and\nDAC. In the 80s,Jamaattook partin themassmovementforrestoration of democracy side by\nside with the twomajor political parties, namely the BNP and the Awami League. In thislong\nstruggle forrestoration of democracy there were liaison committees ofthe BNP,Jamaat and the\nAwami League and the liaison committees ofthe three parties used to sitregularly to formulate\ncommon programmes. Itis a historicalfactthatJamaat wasthe first political party to raise the\ndemand of holding Parliamentary elections under a neutral CaretakerGovernment. In the\nmovementforincorporating the concept of CaretakerGovernmentin the Constitution Jamaat,\nAwami League and Jatiya Party foughtside by side. They addressed press conferencesfromthe\nsame platform.\nJamaat\u2019s participation in the national elections\nJamaat has been represented in Parliamentsince 1962. It has participated in allthe\nParliamentary and local elections with a view to institutionalising democracy. In the\nParliamentary elections of 1962 Jamaat won 4 seatsin theNational Assembly and 2 seatsin the\nProvincial Assembly fromwhat wasthen East Pakistan. In the general elections of 1970 although\nJamaat did not win any seatin theNational Assembly of East Pakistan, it emerged asthe second\nlargest political party nextto Awami League which had a landslide victory.However, in the\nProvincial Assembly election of 1970 Jamaat won 1 seatin the district of Bogra. Afterthe\nindependence of Bangladesh Jamaat could nottake partin the elections of 1973 because allthe\nIslamic political partiesincluding Jamaat were outlawed.However,Jamaattook partin 1979\nParliamentary elections underthe name IslamicDemocratic League (IDL) and secured 6 seatsin\nParliament with itsleader Mawlana Abdur Rahimelected fromBarisal. In 1986 Jamaat won 10\nseats; in 1991, 18 seats; in 1996, 3 seats; and in 2001, 17 seatsin Parliament.Jamaat hasthe\nsupport of about 15 % ofthe total electorate.Jamaat also participated in the coalitiongovernment of 2001.Jamaat\u2019s Ameer(Chief) Mawlana Matiur RahmanNizami held the\nportfolios of Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Industries while its SecretaryGeneral Mr. Ali\nAhsan Muhammad Mujahid held the portfolio of Ministry of Social Welfare. Itis accepted even\nby the opponents ofJamaatthatthose Ministries were run efficiently and honestly. Itmay be\nmentioned that BangladeshNationalist Party (BNP) could not have formed the governmentin\n1991 withoutthe support ofthe Jamaatin Parliament.\nAllegations of TerrorismagainstJamaat\nAsmentioned earlier,Jamaat believesin democracy, human rights and rule oflaw. In the later\npart of 2005, a series of bomb blaststook place in Bangladesh. The terroristsin the name of\nIslamalso killed two judges ofthe Subordinate court. TheOpponents ofJamaatmade frantic\neffortsto implicate Jamaatin the terrorist attacks.Jamaattook a firmstand againstthose\nterrorists, issued pressstatements, organisedmeetings and rallies acrossthe country. Itis\nlargely due to Jamaat\u2019ssincere effortsthatthe religiousleaders ofthe country throughout\nBangladesh \u2010 fromthe villagesto the capital city\u2010 in one voice condemned those acts of\nterrorism. With public supportthe then coalition government was able to arrestthe terrorists\nand try themin open court and finally they have been sentenced to death.\nAllegations of war crimes againstJamaatleadersOn 16thDecember 1971,the Pakistani Army\nsurrendered inDhaka and ninety three thousand ofthemwere taken as prisoners of war\n(POWs).Out ofthem,there were allegations of war crimes against 195, and they were identified\nassuch by theGovernment of Bangladesh.On 19th July 1973, Parliament passed the\nInternational Crimes(Tribunal) Act 1973 to try the alleged war criminals. Earlier on 15th July\n1973,the Constitution was amended denying the protection offundamentalrightsto the\nalleged war criminals.\nFollowing the Simla Agreementsigned on 2nd July 1972 between IndiraGandhi, Prime Minister\nofIndia and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, President of Pakistan a number of agreements were signed\nbetween India and Pakistan regarding repatriation ofthe POWs.On 9th April 1974, an\nAgreement wassigned between Bangladesh, India and Pakistan inNew Delhi in which, among\notherissues,the question oftrial ofthe 195 POWs wasraised and finally it was decided that\nthey would be repatriated to Pakistan along with the other prisoners withouttrial. For better\nunderstanding, paragraph 15 ofthe 1974 Agreementis quoted below:\u2018In the light ofthe foregoing and, in particular, having regard to the appeal ofthe Prime Minister\nof Pakistan to the people of Bangladesh to forgive and forgetthemistakes ofthe past,the\nForeign Minister of Bangladesh stated thattheGovernment of Bangladesh had decided notto\nproceed with the trials as an act of clemency. It was agreed thatthe 195 prisoners of warmay\nbe repatriated to Pakistan along with the other prisoners of war now in process ofrepatriation\nundertheDelhi Agreement\u2019.\nThus 195 POWs were repatriated to Pakistan, and the question oftheirtrial as war criminals was\nfinally abandoned.\nItshould bementioned that underthe International Crimes(Tribunal) Act, 1973 the Tribunal has\njurisdiction to try and punish the persons who weremembers of any armed, defense or auxiliary\nforces and has committed war crimes or crimes against humanity.No one fromJamaat has ever\nbeen amember of armed, defense or auxiliary forces,therefore,the question oftrying themby\nthe Tribunal does not arise. As amatter offact a Tribunalformed underthe War Crimes Act will\nhave no jurisdiction to try anymember ofJamaat. Allegations are frequentlymade against\nJamaatthatit organised paramilitary forceslike Al\u2010Badr, Al\u2010Shamas and Razakar and committed\natrocitiesin the war ofindependence in 1971.Jamaatstrongly denies any link with such\natrocities. In those daysthe paramilitary forces were organised locally by the thenGovernment\nunder a provincial legislation, namely the Razakar Act 1971 and it had no central command.\nJammat also denies any involvement whatsoever with the abduction andmurder ofjournalists\nand academics.Onemember ofJamaat, Abdul Khalique Mojumder, was prosecuted and\nconvicted by a subordinate courtin the seventiesfor his alleged involvementin the killing of an\nintellectual namely Shahidullah Kaiser, but his conviction had been set aside by theHigh Court.\nThe government did notfile any appeal in the AppellateDivision ofthe Supreme Court against\nthe judgment oftheHigh CourtDivision.\nItistrue thatthe then Jamaat\u2010e\u2010Islami Bangladesh supported the cause of united Pakistan. It\nwasJamaat\u2019s political decision.Nomember ofJamaat was everinvolved with any crime of\nmurder, arson, lootlet alone any crime against humanity. The Bangladesh Collaborators(Special\nTribunals)Order, 1972 was promulgated to set up tribunalsfortrial ofthe individuals or\nmembers of organisations who directly orindirectly acted as collaborators or abettors ofthe\nPakistan Armed forces. This PresidentialOrder waslaterrepealed by the Bangladesh\nCollaborators(Special Tribunal) (Repeal)Ordinance, 1975.On 19th July 1973 Parliament passed\nthe International Crimes(Tribunal) Act 1973 by which a legalframework was created to try the\nwar criminals.Nomember orleader ofJamaat wastried or convicted underthis Act. Previously\nProfessorGolamAzam,the ex Ameer(Chief) ofJamaat was accused of committing atrocities\nduring the war. Thematter wasraised by the then AttorneyGeneral in theHigh CourtDivisionduring the hearing of his citizenship case. Even Mr.Justice Mohammad IsmailUddin Sarker,the\ndissenting Judge who held that ProfessorGolamAzamwas not a citizen of Bangladesh,made\nthe following observations:\n\u2018thatthere is nothing to directly implicate the petitionerin any ofthe atrocities alleged to have\nbeen perpetrated by the Pakistani Army ortheir associates \u2013 the Rajakars, Al Badrs orthe Al\nShams\u2026\u2026..we do notfind anything thatthe petitioner wasin any way directly involved in\nperpetuating the alleged atrocities during the war ofindependence.\u2019\n[See ProfessorGolamAzamVs. Bangladesh (45Dhaka Law Report,High CourtDivision, page\n433]\nThe double standard of a political party\nThe Awami League wasin powerfortwo terms:from1972\u20101975 and 1996\u20102001.During these\ntwo termsthey took no step whatsoeverforthe trial ofthe leaders ofJamaat\u2010e\u2010Islami on the\nallegation ofthe so\u2010called war crime.During themassmovementforrestoration of democracy\nin the 1980s and during themovementfor CaretakerGovernmentin the 1990s,the Awami\nLeague had no difficulty in working side by side with Jamaatleaders who are now accused of\nwar crimes. In the 7 years ofstruggle forrestoration of democracy, numerousmeetings were\nheld between the leaders ofJamaat, BNP and Awami League in which Jamaatleaders namely\nMatiur RahmanNizami, Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mujahid, MohammadQamaruzzaman, Abdul\nQader Molla, ATM Azharul Islamand others participated.On behalf of Awami League Messers\nlate Abdus Samad Azad, AbdulJalil, Tofail Ahmed, Suranjit SenGupta, AmirHossain Amu\nMohammadNasimand others also participated. The evidence ofthosemeetings can be found\nin the pressreports ofthe yearsfromthe 1984\u20101990. Afterthe general elections of 1991, on\nbehalf of Awami League, Mr. AmirHossain Amumade an offerto Jamaatthrough Mr Ali Ahsan\nMohammad Mujahid,the present SecretaryGeneral ofJamaatto formgovernment with the\nhelp of 18 MPs ofJamaat and in return Jamaat was offered 2\u20103ministries with a number ofseats\nreserved for women MPs.Jamaatstraightway refused the offer of Awami League.During the\nmovementfor caretaker governmentthe leaders ofJamaat and Awami League addressed press\nconferencesjointly. In one press conference, addressed fromthe precinct of ParliamentHouse\nin 1996,the then leader oftheOpposition SheikhHasina,the leader ofthe Jamaat\nParliamentary party Matiur RahmanNizami and that ofJatiya Party Moudud Ahmed, attended.\nThis Press conference was also attended, among others, by Mrs. Sajeda Chaudhury, Mr. Suranjit\nSenGupta. The national dailies published photographs ofthat event.Jamaat was not alone to support Pakistan\nJamaatis notthe only political party which supported the cause of united Pakistan. There were\nother parties namely,the MuslimLeague,Nezam\u2010e\u2010IslamParty,JamiyatUlema Islam,the Pro\nChina Communist Party all of which supported the cause of united Pakistan. Besides,there was a\nsizeablemember of prominent personalities which include university professors, doctors,\nengineers, journalists and religiousleaders who supported the cause of united Pakistan.\nAlthough Jamaat accepted Bangladesh since 16thDecember 1971 and it has been working for\nthe welfare of Bangladesh and is committed to preserve itssovereignty, it has been singled out\nand a smear campaign has been going on againstit only forthe narrow political gains of certain\npolitical parties.When the sub\u2010continent was divided into two states; India and Pakistan in\n1947,the MuslimLeague wasin favour ofthe division ofIndia and the Congress wasforthe\nunity ofIndia. After partition the MuslimLeague has been functioning in India and theNational\nCongress worked as a political party until 1970 without any stigma. However, itis unfortunate\nthat after 36 years ofindependence Jamaatis dubbed as an anti liberation force although it has\nbeen sufficiently represented in Parliament and had twoministersin the past coalition\ngovernment.\nViolation of human rights ofJamaat\u2019sleaders\nItis very unfortunate thatleaders of a few political parties and a section ofthe pressin a smear\ncampaign dubbed the top leaders ofJamaat as war criminals. Thisis contrary to all civilized\nnorms and the provisions oflocal and international legislations. A person is presumed innocent\nuntil he is proven guilty by a competent court oflaw and in caseslike this,the burden is on the\nprosecution and the standard of proofis guilty beyond reasonable doubt. Itisreally surprising\nthat when the leadership ofJamaat was notlisted among the 195 who were to be tried for war\ncrimes,they have now been termed as war criminals. Thisis violation of principles of natural\njustice and also violation ofthe fundamentalrights and human rights ofthe Jamaatleaders\nwhich are guaranteed underthe Constitution of Bangladesh and a number ofInternational\nconventionsincluding theUniversalDeclaration ofHuman Rights and International Covenant on\nCivil and Political Rights.\nAPPENDIX\nSimla Agreement\n2 July 1972This agreement on Bilateral Relations between India and Pakistan wassigned afterthe 1971\nIndia\u2010PakistanWar, in which Pakistan was defeated conclusively and which resulted in the\ncreation of Bangladesh. India refrained fromattacking orfinishing off Pakistan and signed this\nagreement with the hope that henceforth the countriesin the region would be able to live in\npeace with each other. The then Pakistani Prime Minister, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, also promised the\nthen Indian Prime Minister, MrsIndiraGandhi,that his country would acceptthe Line of Control\n(LOC) in the state ofJ&K asthe de facto border and would nottry to destabilise it. This was not\nformally entered in the agreement because Bhutto said it would cause domestic problemsfor\nhimatthisjuncture. MrsGandhimagnanimously accepted his promise and did notformalise\nthat part ofthe agreement. But Pakistan, aslater events were to prove, never keptits part of\nthe deal.\nTheGovernment of India and theGovernment of Pakistan are resolved thatthe two countries\nput an end to the conflict and confrontation that have hithertomarred theirrelations and work\nforthe promotion of a friendly and harmoniousrelationship and the establishment of durable\npeace in the sub\u2010continent,so that both countriesmay henceforth devote theirresources and\nenergiesto the pressing task of advancing the welfare oftheir peoples.\nIn orderto achieve this objective,theGovernment ofIndia and theGovernment of Pakistan\nhave agreed asfollows:\n(i) Thatthe principles and purposes offthe Charter oftheUnitedNationsshall govern the\nrelations between the countries;\n(ii) Thatthe two countries are resolved to settle their differences by peacefulmeansthrough\nbilateral negotiations or by any other peacefulmeansmutually agreed upon between them.\nPending the finalsettlement of any ofthe problems between the two countries, neitherside\nshall unilaterally alterthe situation and both shall preventthe organization, assistance or\nencouragement of any acts detrimentalto themaintenance of peaceful and harmonious\nrelations.\n(iii) Thatthe pre\u2010requisite forreconciliation, good\u2010neighbourliness and durable peace between\nthemis a commitment by both countriesto peaceful co\u2010existence,respectfor each other\u2019sterritorial integrity and sovereignty and non\u2010interference in each other\u2019sinternal affairs, on the\nbasis of equality andmutual benefit;\n(iv) Thatthe basic issues and causes of conflict which have bedevilled the relations between the\ntwo countries ofthe lasttwenty\u2010five yearsshall be resolved by peacefulmeans;\n(v) Thatthey shall alwaysrespect each other\u2019s national unity,territorial integrity, political\nindependence and sovereign equality;\n(vi) Thatin accordance with the Charter oftheUnitedNations,they shallrefrain fromthe threat\nor use offorce againstthe territorial integrity or political independence of each other;\n(II) BothGovernments willtake allsteps within their powerto prevent hostile propaganda\ndirected against each other.

TheGovernment ofIndia and theGovernment of Pakistan have\nconcurred in this agreement. The Special Representative ofthe Prime Minister ofIndia, having\nconsulted theGovernment of Bangladesh, has also conveyed the concurrence of Bangladesh\nGovernmentin this agreement.Done inNew Delhi on August 28, 1973 in three originals, all of\nwhich are equally authentic.\nAziz Ahmed\nMinister of State forDefence&Foreign Affairs,Government of Pakistan\nP.N.Haksar\nSpecial Representative ofthe Prime Minister ofIndia\nText ofthe Bangladesh\u2010India\u2010Pakistan Agreement Signed inNew Delhi on April 9, 1974\nOn July 2, 1972,the President of Pakistan and the Prime Minister ofIndia signed an historic\nagreement at Simla under which they resolved that \u201cthe two countries put an end to the conflict\nand confrontation that have hithertomarred theirrelations and work forthe promotion of a\nfriendly and harmoniousrelationship and the establishment of durable peace in the sub\u2010\ncontinent.\u201d The Agreement also provided forthe settlement of \u201ctheir differences by peaceful\nmeansthrough bilateral negotiations or by any other peacefulmeansmutually agreed upon.\u201d\n2. Bangladesh welcomed the Simla Agreement. The Prime Minister of Bangladesh strongly\nsupported its objective ofreconciliation, good neighborliness and establishment of durable\npeace in the sub\u2010continent.\n3. The humanitarian problems arising in the wake ofthe tragic events of 1971 constituted a\nmajor obstacle in the way ofreconciliation and normalization among the countries ofthe sub\u2010\ncontinent. In the absence ofrecognition, it was not possible to have tripartite talksto settle the\nhumanitarian problems as Bangladesh could not participate in such ameeting except on the\nbasis ofsovereign equality.\n4.On April 17, 1973, India and Bangladesh took amajorstep forward to break the deadlock on\nthe humanitarian issues by setting aside the political problemofrecognition. In aDeclaration\nissued on that date they said thatthey \u201care resolved to continue their effortsto reduce tension,\npromote friendly and harmoniousrelationship in the sub\u2010continent and work togethertowards\nthe establishment of a durable peace.\u201d Inspired by this vision and \u201cin the largerinterests of\nreconciliation, peace and stability in the sub\u2010continent\u201d they jointly proposed thatthe problem\nofthe detained and stranded personsshould be resolved on humanitarian considerations\nthrough simultaneousrepatriation of allsuch persons exceptthose Pakistani prisoners of war\nwhomight be required by theGovernment of Bangladesh fortrial on certain charges.5. Following theDeclaration there were a series oftalks between India and Bangladesh and India\nand Pakistan. These talksresulted in an agreement atDelhi on August 28, 1973 between India\nand Pakistan with the concurrence of Bangladesh which provided for a solution ofthe\noutstanding humanitarian problems.\n6. In pursuance ofthis Agreement,the process oftree\u2010way repatriation commenced on\nSeptember 19, 1973. So far nearly 300,000 persons have been repatriated which has generated\nan atmosphere ofreconciliation and paved the way for normalization ofrelationsin the sub\u2010\ncontinent.\n7. In February 1974,recognition took place thusfacilitating the participation of Bangladesh in\nthe tripartitemeeting envisaged in theDelhi Agreement, on the basis ofsovereign equality.\nAccordingly,His ExcellencyDr. KamalHossain, Foreign Minister oftheGovernment of\nBangladesh,His Excellency Sardar Swaran Singh, Minister of External Affairs,Government of\nIndia andHis Excellency Mr. Aziz Ahmed, Minister of State forDefence and Foreign Affairs ofthe\nGovernment of Pakistan,metinNew DelhifromApril 5 to April 9, 1974 and discussed the\nvariousissuesmentioned in theDelhi Agreement, in particularthe question ofthe 195 prisoners\nof war and the completion ofthe three\u2010way process ofrepatriation involving Bangaleesin\nPakistan, Pakistanisin Bangladesh and Pakistani prisoners of warin India.\n8. The Ministersreviewed the progress ofthe three\u2010way repatriation undertheDelhi Agreement\nof August 28, 1973.
