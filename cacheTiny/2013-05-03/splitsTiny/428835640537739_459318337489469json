A revolution sparked by injustices committed by the Bangladeshi Government. A revolution caused by the government\u2019s support of war-mongers in the blogosphere and shahbag who incited religious hatred against a 90% Muslim majority country, the 3rd largest Muslim population in the world. Since then, government forces have killed 200 anti government protestors, arrested the entire leadership of all the opposition groups and reportedly subjected them to inhumane torture in the squalid prison conditions. Widespread allegations of human rights abuses, battering of women in public, kidnappings of student leaders, arresting of women\u2019s group activists and extra judicial killings are only the tip of the iceberg.  Dozens of journalists and editors have been arrested and subjected to electrocution and evidence has emerged that holes were cut in their legs using drill machines.\r\nDespite the death of freedom of press, obscene insults against God and His Prophet (saws), the death sentences that were passed illegally on renowned elderly Islamic scholars and numerous spates of violence by pro government forces on innocent civilians, a revolution in Bangladesh is born!  The Bangladeshi government rejected aiding the Rohingya Bengalis of Burma and it rejected the aid offered by the UK in support of the Savar Plaza garment tragedy. Rather, the owner of the plaza is a well known thug of the Awami Government in Bangladesh.\r\nNotwithstanding the government massacring all the BDR officers (the only failsafe mechanism that the people of Bangladesh relied upon) and the ethnic cleansing of half a million Biharis, the people of Bangladesh have finally united to say \u201cNo more\u2026 and not in our name!\u201d They have taken to the streets countless times reportedly in their millions, calling for regime change and lasting justice.  They want the Hasina government out for good.  This May the 5th, the voice of the people will climax as ordinary Bangladeshis have pledged to lay siege to the capital city, Dhaka until the Hasina government meets the revolution\u2019s demands or falls.  The masses in Bangladesh are anticipating heavy casualties and loss of lives at the hands of the government forces on the day of the revolution, May the 5th.  They say that they are willing to pay the price feesabeelillaah. May God protect them. This revolution is being likened to the revolutions sweeping the Arab world to the point that it is now being referred to as the Bangla Spring!\r\nFreedom March in London \r\nAnd to mark this revolution, regular British Bangladeshis will coincide this event by holding an epic demonstration on May the 5th also, at 1pm in Hyde Park London.  Once assembled, they plan to march to the Bangladeshi Embassy to call for justice in Bangladesh.\r\nThe following are some steps you need to take to help the ordinary people of Bangladesh:\r\nMake yourself counted by showing up at the Freedom March London, May 5th.\r\nInvite friends, family, neighbours and relatives to attend the Freedom March with you.\r\nFollow the @Feb28info twitter account by clicking the \u2018follow\u2019 button.
