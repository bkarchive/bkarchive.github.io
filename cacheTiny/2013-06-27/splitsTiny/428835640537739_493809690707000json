It normally takes 7 to 14 days to get a visa.\r\n \r\nUmrah season starts in the month of Safar, the second month in the Islamic calendar, until the end of Ramadan.\r\n \r\nUntil 1 July, about 3.8 million Umrah pilgrims entered the Kingdom, which is an increase of 400,000 compared to the same period last year, according to a report issued by the Ministry of Haj recently.","picture":"https:\/\/fbcdn-photos-g-a.akamaihd.net\/hphotos-ak-ash2\/1003895_493809684040334_1775156611_s.jpg"}
