Moreover, the party, if elected in the next general elections, will help the institution return to its original structure,\u201d said Alamgir.\n \nThis came as he was speaking with journalists at BNP\u2019s Nayapaltan office in Dhaka Thursday. Earlier on Thursday morning, the BNP leader met with Yunus and the two held a meeting at Yunus Centre in Dhaka\u2019s Mirpur.\n \n\u201cThe government since the very outset got embroiled in dispute with the bank and its founder. The government at various points has dishonoured and exhibited bad behaviour against Yunus. It also harassed him several times in different ways. Bangladesh has so much to gain from a visionary and knowledgeable person like Yunus,\u201d said Alamgir.\n \nSpeaking of Padma bridge tender, the BNP leader said: \u201cTender of the bridge with own funding is nothing insane talk. The bridge can\u2019t be built without WB (World Bank) funding.\u201d"}
