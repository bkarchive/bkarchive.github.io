The complaint alleged that Rana's posting likened the Prime Minister to a \u2018hyena\u2019 who feasted on the country and was now eyeing the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology. It is sad that such a vague comment has put some one in to prison. This is the example of our judiciary in dismal state. Where people are accused of murder, they are released on ground of compassion by the president, yet a mere threat receives a 7 years sentence and that to a BUET teacher.\n\nOn the contrary, face book blogger Asif Muhiuddin who made sacrilegious comment that upset millions of Muslim and led to Shapla Chottor killings has been released by the court on bail. The real hyenas are this government and the courts that feast on innocent people.\n\n-Fanpost"}
