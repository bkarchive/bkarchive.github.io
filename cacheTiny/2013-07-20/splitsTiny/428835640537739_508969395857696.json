Only 19 percent of the sum total of students has passed; such inharmonious result can never be accepted. The student section believes that such baseless result is published as a part of deep conspiracies against national education system. This is why they are out with demands to mark out the papers again and to mend the existing education system. We completely support the movement of the students in this regard. Besides, We\u2019d like to urge the government to come forward with proper solutions to the problems of the students; rather than to brand the movement as \u2018political\u2019 just the way how it was done in the past oftentimes.\u201d"}
