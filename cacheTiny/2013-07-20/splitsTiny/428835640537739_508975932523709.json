However, a gainsaying statement to that report from Chhatrashibir was also published yesterday. It is well-known to all the quarters that Chhatrashibir is the one and only student organization in Bangladesh which is completely free from drug practices and also works to keep the students away from drug dependencies. The brave leaders and activists of Chhatrashibir have been working at the plain risk as well as cost of their lives for the sake of the country and Islam and they will keep this tempo up InShaAllah. We even feel otherwise to gainsay such worst type of reports.\u201d\n\nHe urged the concerned media and media men to refrain from publishing such false and fabricated reports in the coming days."}
