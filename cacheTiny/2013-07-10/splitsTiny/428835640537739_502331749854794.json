Shibir Secretary-General Abdul Jabbar strongly slammed administration\u2019s denial of such permission.\n\nIn a formal statement, the Secretary-General of Bangladesh Islami Chhatrashibir Abdul Jabbar said, \u201cTo uphold the dignity of the Month of Ramadan is an obligation of every Muslim. Each year, we hold rallies with intent to create awareness among the masses and, as usual, we sought permission to the government authority to do so but, very pathetically, permission was refused by this anti-Islam government. Such blatant hostility is a plain threat to the sentiment of Muslims of this country as a whole.\u201d\n\nHe further said, \u201cWe think this nasty government took plainly the anti-Islam stance by not allowing Chhatrashibir to bring out rallies in honor of the Month of Ramadan. The government should bear in mind the very teachings of 5 recent City Corporation polls and refrain from barring the Muslims from performing their religious obligations.\u201d"}
