Attempts are being made to kill those who throughout their lifetime spread the message of the Quran across the country. The name of Allama Sayeedi is, among many, noteworthy. A farcical tribunal has already been set up to run a farcical trial in that regard. Hundreds of thousands of Jamaat-Shibir men are being attacked tortured and maltreated merely because they long for Quranic regime in this land. What a shame it is for a Muslim Majority country like Bangladesh!! We strongly urge the government to stop torturing these Quran-loving people in this very Month of Quran.\u201d\n\nThe leaders urged the student segment to take the Month of Ramadan as a month of training and to utilize the teachings of this Month to establish Quranic regime and to combat the quarters hostile thereto.\n\nFurthermore, the leaders urged the government to make restaurants shut down at daytime, obscenity disappear and dignity of Ramadan be upheld.\n\nBangladesh Islami Chhatrashibir launched rallies and held gatherings countrywide today welcoming the Month of Ramadan."}
