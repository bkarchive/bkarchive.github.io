This is reiterated in their forums and statements to the media outlets who host them as experts providing certain and absolute judgements.\r\n\r\nTheir counterparts in the Islamic world and voices in our media then echo those statements accepting them as undoubted and unmistakable facts.\r\n\r\nEvents in Egypt over the last few months have provided abundant material for those theses, seminars and claims, and their popularity has risen once again.\r\n\r\nBut how credible are these claims? Is what is known as political Islam undergoing a serious and growing decline and heading for ultimate failure and imminent demise? Or is it just a matter of a few steps back here and there in preparation for a new launch and in order to move forward, such that those setbacks are simply dips in an overall upward curve?\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.middleeastmonitor.com\/articles\/africa\/8087-how-credible-is-the-claim-of-the-failure-of-political-islam","picture":"http:\/\/photos-c.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-ash3\/t1\/1426737_567527823335186_1863308041_s.jpg"}
