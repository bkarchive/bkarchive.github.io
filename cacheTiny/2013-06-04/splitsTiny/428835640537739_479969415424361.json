Among them 1082 deaths have been reported to be political and 652 deaths due to extrajudicial killings. These figures are alarming by any standard. In spite of this bleak eye-opener from police sources and human rights group, Awami chief Sheikh Hasina continue to cherish the false belief that her government is the best. Just today Akbar Ali Khan said, \u201cSheikh Hasina holds more power than even the Moguls Of India\u201d it is said, power makes people blind, and indeed Sheikh Hasina has become too blind to see the truth. Our country is not safe at the hand of this government, those who try to impose a set of values that are fundamentally against the overall belief of the majority, can expect resistance from an increasingly beleaguered population. Terrorising people only works to certain extends, but the power to resist is even stronger. People want a swift and dramatic escape from the brutality of Sheikh Hasina\u2019s regime, which is not an impossible victory to achieve \n\u098f\u0995 \u09a8\u099c\u09b0\u09c7 \u09ea \u09ac\u099b\u09b0 \u09eb \u09ae\u09be\u09b8\n\u0996\u09c1\u09a8 : \u09e7\u09ee\u09e8\u09ee\u09ef\n\u09b0\u09be\u099c\u09a8\u09c8\u09a4\u09bf\u0995 \u09b9\u09a4\u09cd\u09af\u09be : \u09e7\u09e6\u09ee\u09e8\n\u09ac\u09bf\u099a\u09be\u09b0\u09ac\u09b9\u09bf\u09b0\u09cd\u09ad\u09c2\u09a4 \u09b9\u09a4\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u0995\u09be\u09a3\u09cd\u09a1 : \u09ec\u09eb\u09e8\n\u0997\u09a3\u09aa\u09bf\u099f\u09c1\u09a8\u09bf\u09a4\u09c7 \u09a8\u09bf\u09b9\u09a4 : \u09ec\u09e9\u09ee\n\nMozafor Ali"}
