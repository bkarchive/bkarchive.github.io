Sub-section 6 prohibits using \"offensive, abusive, vulgar expressions.\"\r\nAwami League Whip ASM Feroz termed MP Ranu's statement 'indecent' and called for expunging it from the proceedings.\r\n\r\nSpeaker Chaudhury said the remarks would be examined and excluded as per Section 307. She gave similar assurances on speeches of Papia.\r\n\r\nBNP MPs, joining Parliament after 83 business days, walked into the House led by MK Anwar on Sunday.\r\n\r\nSpeaking on the supplementary budget, Ranu claimed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's family members were involved in corruption in the Pama bridge project.\r\n\r\nA MP from the seats reserved for women in Parliament, she claimed the World Bank pulled out of the project as information on 12 percent bribe went out. She said names of those involved with 10 percent of the 'bribe' had been published but those involved with the rest two percent had not been named.\r\n\r\n\"A recent report run by a Canadian TV channel said the Prime Minister's family members are involved with the two percent,\" she said without specifying.\r\n\r\nRanu warned the opposition would not let the government play games over the caretaker government issue.\r\n\r\nShe said ruling party's assertions to bring back BNP's Senior Vice Chairman Tarique Rahman with Interpol's assistance was merely a 'political game\u2019.\r\n\r\nLast month, Home Minister MK Alamgir had said the government would take steps as per court directives to haul back Tarique for violating bail bond conditions signed during the last caretaker government.\r\n\r\nRanu suggested the Awami League leaders start working on saving their skin instead of going after Tarique. She said the government will have to pay for what it did to the opposition BNP-Jamaat alliance, and the Hifazat-e Islam.\r\n\r\nThe BNP deputy said Information Minister Hasanul Haq Inu was the 'greatest enemy' of the media and alleged the government was controlling mediapersons \"with guns and sticks.\"\r\n\r\nShe alleged the Prime Minister was an 'instigator of atheism' and took a swipe at the Home Minister.\r\n\r\nEarlier in the session, Papiya, speaking on a Point of Order, 'denounced' Hasina's statement on Tarique on Thursday.\r\n\r\nShe said the BNP Senior Vice Chairman was abroad for treatment. \"He does not do politics by signing bonds.\"\r\n\r\nPapiya alleged the ruling MPs were delivering false, fabricated and confusing statements.\r\n\r\nAt one stage, Papiya, known for launching scathing attacks on the ruling party, termed Foreign Minister Dipu Moni a 'hybrid' leader.\r\n\r\nSeveral ruling party lawmakers, including Deputy Leader of Parliament Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, tried to attract the Speaker's attention as the BNP MP was speaking.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Speaker did not turn off the mike in a mark of flexible attitude towards the opposition.\r\n\r\nRuling party's Fazle Rabbi Miah MP, speaking after Papiya, demanded that her statement be expunged.\r\n\r\nAbdul Mannan MP also echoed Miah and said opposition lawmaker Papiya had made 'indecent' remarks about the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister.\r\n\r\n\"I strongly condemn her statements,\" he said.","picture":"https:\/\/fbcdn-photos-f-a.akamaihd.net\/hphotos-ak-prn1\/184444_483266025094700_545787712_s.jpg"}
