The bills received from the rest 62 visits show that Rs. 642.45 crore was spent on air travel.\n\nIndia\u2019s Central Information Commission, in a recent order, had directed the Cabinet Secretariat to make public expenses incurred on the travel of ministers and VVIPs because of \u2018large public interest\u2019 in the matter.\n\n\u2018We have been noticing a lot of public interest in the visit of such high dignitaries as the President, the Vice President and the Prime Minister of India. Quite often, one comes across RTI applications seeking similar information about these visits,\u2019 Chief Information Commissioner (CIC) Satyananda Mishra had said, reports NDTV.","picture":"https:\/\/fbcdn-photos-d-a.akamaihd.net\/hphotos-ak-prn2\/10587_483260705095232_949990222_s.jpg"}
