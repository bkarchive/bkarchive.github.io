The opposition is being sentenced to death now for the last one year.\n\nIllegal removal of the world icon the Noble Laureate Dr. Muhammad Yunus was the first step by the Bangladesh government in this direction. Although elections are due, the opposition leaders are being killed and sentenced to be hanged through kangaroo courts.\n\nOpposition has boycotted the elections because of the ruthlessness of this regime, which is killing all voices, hanging opposition leaders, and suppressing labor and media.\n\nBangladesh is a progressive country. It is the second largest exporter of textile products after China, amounting to $18 billion dollars in 2011. Livelihood of people is improving.\n\nAll that is now at risk at the hands of this regime. Millions of people have been a casualty of civil war in the past and, God forbid, it is about to happen again. Bangladesh, a country about the size of New York State and with a population of about 150 million is at the brink of a disaster if political reconciliation does not take place.\n\nThe government is showing absolutely no regard towards human life, the protection of human rights, or the rule of law. It is actively participating in state sponsored terrorism.\n\nIt is time to act NOW! It is time to put back value to life in Bangladesh!\n\nHere is what you can do:\nCall President Obama:\n\nCall 202-456-1111 or write to him here.\n\nIt is in our national interest that Bangladesh does not become another chaotic terrorist producing factory.\nAsk him to do the following:\n\nAsk Bangladesh government to restore constitution by establishing an interim government for fair elections\nCancel orders to hang opposition leaders to death, as demanded by Human Rights Watch\nThese two measures can help stop the civil war which has already begun. All imports from Bangladesh must be put on hold until Bangladesh complies with these two demands\nPlease call today. Saving one life is like saving the whole humanity.\nCopy and Distribute this Alert to Your Friends and Relatives.\n\nPlease download and print this pdf file for distribution in your community.\n\nWe work together as a small network to help Bangladesh move forward instead of sliding backward because of political conflicts.
