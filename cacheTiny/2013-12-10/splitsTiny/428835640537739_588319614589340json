Prosecutors described him as the \"Butcher of Mirpur\", a Dhaka suburb where he committed most of the atrocities.\r\n\r\nA domestic war crime court had originally sentenced him to life imprisonment in February, but the sentence prompted protests by tens of thousands of secular demonstrators who viewed it as too lenient.\r\n\r\nUnder pressure, the government amended the war crime law retroactively to allow it to appeal the sentence and seek the death penalty, which the Supreme Court then handed down in September.\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/southasia\/2013\/12\/bangladesh-set-execute-opposition-leader-20131210143823373364.html","picture":"https:\/\/fbcdn-photos-h-a.akamaihd.net\/hphotos-ak-prn2\/1454543_588319591256009_1596819029_s.jpg"}
