I have written about the claim that the warrant of execution is defence here( http:\/\/bangladeshwarcrimes.blogspot.com\/2013\/12\/is-mollas-warrant-of-execution-defective.html ).\n\nBy the way, fact that defence lawyers have sent a notice to prosecutors informing them that they were about to file a review shows how dishonest the state minister for law is (see 8.20)  when he said that he was surprised that the lawyers had not yet filed a review. By the way, the lawyers should have a month to do that according to the appellate division rules"}
