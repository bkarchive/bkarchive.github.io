It reads:\n\n    \u201cI am deeply concerned at reports of plans to execute Abdul Qader Mollah in the coming days.\n    \u201cThe UK opposes the death penalty in all circumstances as a matter of principle. We consider that its use undermines human dignity and that there is no conclusive evidence of its deterrent value. We further note that Abdul Qader Mollah was sentenced to death following an appeal permitted under retrospectively applied legislation, and that he was not permitted to review his sentence before the Supreme Court. Bangladesh\u2019s commitments under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) require that all citizens be treated equally before the law.\n    \u201cThe UK calls again for Bangladesh to implement a moratorium on the death penalty leading to the eventual abolition of the death penalty.\u201d\n\nThe toughest statement so far from the UK government, who in public have been very reluctant to say very much on this issue\n\nhttp:\/\/bangladeshwarcrimes.blogspot.ca\/2013\/12\/mollas-impending-execution.html"}
