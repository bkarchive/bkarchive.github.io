It calls for halting the execution, and states that the EU 'notes the concerns that have been expressed by the United Nations special rapporteurs on independence of judges and lawyers and on summary executions regarding the lack of opportunity for appeal or review of the sentence. The European Union calls for these concerns to be addressed before taking the process further.'\n\n    The European Union reiterates its opposition to the death penalty\n    The European Union is opposed to the use of capital punishment in all cases and under all circumstances, and has consistently called for its universal abolition. The European Union has followed the judicial proceedings in Bangladesh concerning the crimes committed during the war preceding the independence of Bangladesh in 1971. From the start of the trials, the European Union has repeatedly stressed its concern about the possible application of the death penalty under the International Crimes (Tribunals) Act.\n\n    The case of Mr. Abdul Quader Mollah has now reached a stage where an execution of the death sentence given by the Supreme Court on 17th September could be imminent. The European Union notes the concerns that have been expressed by the United Nations special rapporteurs on independence of judges and lawyers and on summary executions regarding the lack of opportunity for appeal or review of the sentence. The European Union calls for these concerns to be addressed before taking the process further.\n\n    In this context the EU reiterates its position regarding the recent death penalties issued by the International Crimes Tribunal and the Supreme Court as well as the 152 death sentences that were recently handed down in the trial following the BDR mutiny in 2009. The European Union calls on the Bangladeshi authorities to commute these sentences and to introduce a moratorium on executions as a first step towards definitive abolition of capital punishment"}
