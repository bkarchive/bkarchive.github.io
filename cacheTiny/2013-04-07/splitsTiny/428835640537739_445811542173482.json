It's a historical Merger. Huge Long March ever in the history of Bangladesh. Millions of people were there. I want to share my expression with u guys. There was too much sunlight and the weather was too hot also. After a time being, for doing slogans I was too much thirst. And thought to go for search of water. When I started to go, one of Hefajat Islam bro came to me offering a bottle of water. I was surprised!! Thanked him with ZajakAllah. It was a heavenly feeling. I also saw some people there distributing us dry foods and water. I saw one who was offering watermelon for free buying from a temporary shop by his own fund. Some people were maintaining security. Police were resting, watching and listening the speeches. Everyone was giving priority to others while sitting, drinking, taking foods. Awesome! Speeches of different scholars were also tremendous, exiting.\r\nAt the end, the best achievement of this huge assemblage was Muslim Brotherhood. Muslims are united. ALLAHU AKBAR!","picture":"http:\/\/photos-h.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-ash3\/5324_445811505506819_498278866_s.jpg"}
