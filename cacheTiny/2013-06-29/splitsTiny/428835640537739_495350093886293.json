Such brutality has created suffocation for all peace loving people of Bangladesh. This situation needs to be changed as soon as possible.\nBesides, as a democratic country, Bangladesh is now at a political crossroads. The autocratic activities of the present government are leading the country to jeopardy. If the Parliament majority is used as a political weapon to demolish all opposition men and to formulate the Constitution of the Country of their own accord, then it will worsen again the already worsened dismal socio-political situation of the country. The image of our country to the outer world is also a matter of concern and being tarnished day by day. All of the issues must be solved politically with a fair intention. Only then, the goal of democracy in Bangladesh can be achieved."}
