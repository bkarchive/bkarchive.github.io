There is an unwritten contract between BAL and India that in return of everything free India gives Hasina and her govt the state power through all kind of physical and logistic support totally based on shameless conspiracy against the people of Bangladesh and their own religion and culture. In order to do this India has a very deep and long term plot and in short it is \" making Bangladesh politically very unstable so that there will no progress in any sector in the country and as a result the nation will suffer long term poverty in terms of basic needs of life and most importantly EDUCATION. By the time this poor nation will severely be starving for these two they will see nothing left in the country rather everything either already in the big belly of big brother India or in full control of big devil India. In that drastic situation for survival people can only beg Alms to the Kind neighbour India who is waiting in Trap Hole and this is the perfect situation to make Bangladeshi nation swallow whatever they give in the name of help\/support\/aid or friendship. But BAL and Hasina govt do not have this insight to understand and ponder because of their inborn corrupt nature rather what they want is state power which they only can achieve through India and other enemies of Bangladesh or in broad sense the enemies of humanity. But no one would do this job to elevate any group to the state power without their benefit and the most wanted benefit of these enemies of humanity is to spread and establish their culture in Muslim lands. To do this they take any step\/s, no matter how corrupt these actions are and never their hands shake a little to do this. So nothing is free.\n\n-Fan post"}
