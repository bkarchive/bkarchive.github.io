Due to the arrest, torture, harassment and killings carried out by the law enforcing agencies, panic and fear has been spread among the people of all walks of life. Every corner of the country has turned into a jail now. Over 30,000 activists of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami and Bangladesh Islami Chhatrashibir have been detained, 5000, out of 20,000 hurt, have been seriously injured and over 600 have been killed by the law enforcement agencies during the regime of this government. Despite government\u2019s unprecedented persecution, Bangladesh Islami Chhatrashibir has continued constructive movement protesting the state-sponsored torture on the opposition. Price hike, terrorism and extortion by the ruling party men and, also, by the law enforcing agency members and lack of good governance have created difficulties for the masses in living a normal life. Awami Leage government has also signed several tactics with the neighboring country seriously prejudicing national interest. They are surely pledge-bound to deactivate Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami and Bangladesh Islami Chhatrashibir since they count these two outfits as plain threats to their ill-motivated agenda. Top leaders of Jamaat-e-Islami have been brought under trial for so called \u2018crimes against humanity\u2019. Despite national and international criticism, government has continued this farcical trial.\r\nBangladesh Islami Chhatrashibir, one of the top dynamic and leading Student Organization in South Asia, has been protesting against government\u2019s autocratic activities since the very beginning. Failing to stop the anti-government movement amid torture by the law enforcing agencies, the government has now been killing Shibir men by kidnapping them earlier. Thereby, they are trying to panic Shibir leaders and activists.\r\n\r\nGovernment\u2019s dirty \u2018gunfight drama\u2019:\r\nRecently, Abdullah Omar Nasif Shahadat, a Shibir activist of Rajshahi city, has been kidnapped from the capital city on May 4, 2013, and killed by the members of Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) on May 12, 2013 near his rural residence at Kajla in Rajshahi. His brother Shohel (Advocate) said, \u201cWe talked with Shahadat at 1.00 pm over phone that day. But, after a while, phone calls were not received. However, I messaged to his phone at around 4:00 pm but, soon, his phone was switched off\u201d.\r\nMr Shohel also said, \u201cAll our attempts to trace him failed abjectly. On last May 5, 2013, we knew that Rapid Action Battalion (RAB)-3 has arrested him and, on last May 8, 2013, at noon, RAB-5 (in Rajshahi) told us that a shibir man will be brought from Dhaka to Rajshahi under their custody and also told us to contact them after 8:00 pm. But they changed their tone when we contacted them at night\u201d.\r\nOn last May 11, at around 2:00 pm, parents of Shahadat went to RAB-5 Head Quarter in Rajshahi city to see their beloved son but failed. 15 hours later, on May 12 at around 3:00 am, RAB shot Shahadat dead in Kajla Radio center playground.\r\nRAB-5 claimed that \u2018Shahadat was killed in gunfight with them\u2019. But the fact was totally different.\r\nOn condition of anonymity, two eye witnesses, who saw the scene how Shahadat was brought to the playground at that night, said, \u201cMembers of RAB-5 brought Shahadat by a patrol van at that night. 25-30 RAB personnel engaged in the operation. Shadahat was senseless and his eyes were tied with cloths. RAB men dragged senseless Shahadat to the ground and stood in circle. Then they shouted \u2018Allahu Akbar\u2019 and opened fire at the senseless body of Shahadat.\u201d\r\nLocals said, \u201cWe heard sound of six rounds of firing and we went out to know the fact\u201d. RAB-5 personnel told the locals, \u201cShahadat with others were planning to create violence in a meeting here. They dared to be in gunfight with us. This man died when we opened fire while others fled the scene\u201d.\r\nLocals also said, \u201cWe don\u2019t believe that factious story. There were six marks of bullet injury in the body of Shahadat. The right wrist of Shahadat was isolated and the right leg was broken due to bullets triggered. There, on his chest, were holes denoting bullet injury; one through the belly and another on the back. All of these prove that Shahadat was killed from touching distance\u201d.\r\n\r\nHow was Shahadat\u2019s character? Was he a terrorist?\r\nMd Omar Nasif Shahadat was born on December 1, 1984, in his grandfathers\u2019 residence. His father\u2019s name is Md Akhtaruzzaman Manu and mother\u2019s name is Sabiha Begum. He was second among two daughters and two sons of his parents. He passed his childhood and adolescence in his village Kajla. He was sympathetic to the helpless people since early age. He was a skilled sports organizer. He was elected \u2018the best pace bowler-2006\u2019 in Rajshahi district. \r\nLocal young boys loved him very much. He received his primary education from the Kajla Government Promary School. He passed Secondary School Certificate (SSC) examination in 2001 from the Mosjid Mission Academy, Binodpur branch, and Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) examination in 2004 from Agrani College, RUET branch. In 2006, he got admitted into Rajshahi Model College, Horian, in Degree (Honours) course. Later, due to different causes, he couldn\u2019t continue his study.\r\nShahadat was sympathetic to the people from his childhood. He proved this attitude by marrying an orphan girl who lost her parents in her childhood. In 2004, Shahadat married Rina Begum Reshmi residing in a village adjacent to his. They have a six year-old son named Arefin Ahmmed Saimum.\r\n\r\nSpeechless Parents and wife losing Shahadat:\r\nParents of Shahadat are speechless after the murder of their beloved son. They often fall sick. His wife is in horrible uncertainties. Six year-boy Saimum often asks when his father will come back once again. But, who will answer Saimum? He doesn\u2019t understand even what death is. How the parents, wife, son and other friends and relatives will bear the pain of Shahadat\u2019s absence?\r\nGovernmental actions prove that they have gone crazy on the face of opposition movement. But, the nation wants to see no more extra-judicial killings. They want to put an end to such kinds of unjust and unjustifiable activities.","picture":"https:\/\/fbcdn-photos-g-a.akamaihd.net\/hphotos-ak-ash2\/1044181_495356447218991_1492179948_s.jpg"}
