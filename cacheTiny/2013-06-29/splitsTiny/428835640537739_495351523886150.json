Any trace of any of them is yet to be found.\r\n \r\nAl Mukaddas came to Dhaka on 2nd February 2012 for some personal chores. Waliullah came to Dhaka on 3rd February 2012. Both of them intended to return to Kushtia on 4th February midnight by a bus of Hanif Enterprise (Bus no - Jhenaidah 3750) where two seats (C1 & C2) were booked for them in the name of Wali. The bus was intercepted at Savar at midnight at around 1:00 am. A few RAB personnel and plain clothed DB men got on board and took both of them down. Then they were taken into a white Microbus waiting outside. All of those were testified by Sumon, the supervisor of the Bus. \r\nHowever, Police, RAB and other security forces explicitly denied the fact of abduction of those two students. Despite the claims of the family and friends and the testimony of the witnesses, they did not admit that black operation till today and the fact is now that two brilliant youths Al-Mukaddas and Waliullah seemingly disappeared forever.","picture":"http:\/\/photos-h.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-ash3\/942316_495351517219484_1712811416_s.jpg"}
