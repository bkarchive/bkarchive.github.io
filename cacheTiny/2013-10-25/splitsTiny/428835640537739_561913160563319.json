The situation of Bangladesh is to me, how hasina wanted the situation has happened. She wanted to bypass the 25th October in any means then she can take control of the situation. Now they will start arresting opposition activists and then they will force opposition to come to the election under them. If they can come to power we all know what will happened in the coming years. I am may be wrong, but what in my mind is, a decision should be made to take revenge when govt. force will go to arrest the oppositions, in that case few people will die but they will stop arresting people without any reason. In any way , if BAL come to power opposition will be vanished and general people will die. This is time to take the correct decision. Any mistakes will create a dark future for the nation.\n-Abu Abdullah"}
