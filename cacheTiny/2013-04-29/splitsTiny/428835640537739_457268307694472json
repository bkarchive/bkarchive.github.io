His father Abdul Khalek and four factory bosses are among the others detained.\nAt least 3,000 people are estimated to have been in the Rana Plaza building when it collapsed. About 2,430 are now known to have survived but hundreds are dead or missing.\nOn Sunday night, rescuers working deep inside the rubble were told to leave, as cranes were brought in to begin lifting the heavy blocks of fallen concrete.\nRescue co-ordinators said that work with heavy-lifting gear would be done carefully to avoid further collapses and to protect bodies trapped under the debris as much as possible.\nFire brigade chief Brig Gen Ali Ahmed Khan said crews had seen bodies lying on the ground inside, but that \"no-one was seen alive\".\nAnger at the building's collapse has triggered days of violent protests in Dhaka demanding those responsible be punished and for an improvement in factory conditions.\nGarment industry workers across the country were given the weekend off, in the hope that the anger would fade.\nBut on Monday, thousands of workers walked out of factories in the Ashulia and Gazipur industrial districts shortly after they opened, and staged a protest march, reportedly setting fire to an ambulance.\nBangladesh has one of the largest garment industries in the world, providing cheap clothing for major Western retailers that benefit from its widespread low-cost labour.\nBut the industry has been widely criticised for its low pay and limited rights given to workers and for the often dangerous working conditions in garment factories."}
