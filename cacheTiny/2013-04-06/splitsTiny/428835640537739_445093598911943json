Few days age I went to trade fair in Rajshahi, I was inside the stadium, then suddenly police started firing and blowing tier-cell in street fight against Shibir, I with everyone inside felt so frighten with the sound only , but after coming back home I thought that about those who were in the streets , bullets was passing beside them, may be they were running everywhere, But what is true, they would come in the streets nextday again again and again... where they are and where im. where we are ? Im trying to be a part of Shibir for a long time, but i cant. coz it takes a lot to be a part of Shibir. Its not easy as others think. It takes complete Iman, love of Rasul(SA) more then your own life and everything else...... whats more you need to be ready to die FISABILILLAH. Inn Sha ALLAH I\u2019ll be strong oneday to be a part of them.\n-Taqbeer Hasan"}
