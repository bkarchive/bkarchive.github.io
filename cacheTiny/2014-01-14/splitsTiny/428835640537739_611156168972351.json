His statement is as follows:\r\n\r\n\u201cA group comprising several policemen led by the Debhata police station\u2019s officer-in-charge, picked Jamaat activist Anarul Islam (30) up from his hatchery on Tuesday morning and fired bullet on him. He later died while taking to the nearest hospital. The way he had been picked up from his business establishment is very sad and inhuman. I am condemning this painful incident vehemently and urging the government to take punitive measures against this OC immediately.\r\n\r\nKilling innocent people by the law enforcers, the government once again proved that, the nation is facing severe state backed terrorism. None is safe from the cruel activities of this government. The government is talking against the anarchy in speeches and statements, but they are causing anarchy by killing people by itself. I am calling the government to stop these anti-humanitarian activities immediately.\u201d","picture":"http:\/\/photos-e.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-ash3\/t1\/1525275_611156075639027_1524680785_s.jpg"}
