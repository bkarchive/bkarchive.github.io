No way: Nasim\r\n\r\n Awami League (AL) presidium member Md Nasim said the much-awaited dialogue with the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) couldn\u2019t be held outside the national parliament.\r\n\u201cThere is no possibility of holding talks outside the parliament. If there is a discussion, it will be inside the parliament,\u201d said Nasim.\r\n \r\nThis came as he was speaking at a discussion arranged by Sechhashebok League at AL office in Dhaka\u2019s Bangabandhu Avenue Friday.\r\n \r\nNasim opined that the Awami League won\u2019t let a situation like 1\/11 evolve again. He also called upon the opposition to come to the parliament for talks.\r\n \r\n\u201cPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina made a call for holding discussion freely. The opposition leader, however, ruled that out by terming it \u2018drama\u2019 and \u2018mockery\u2019 and issued a 48-hour ultimatum for restoration of caretaker government system. We have to flee the country if we want to discuss caretaker government,\u201d said the AL leader.\r\n \r\nSpeaking of the BNP Chairperson, Nasim said: \u201cDon\u2019t do politics with dead bodies. Bangladeshis don\u2019t believe in politics of dead bodies anymore.\u201d\r\n \r\nSpeaking of Hifazat-e-Islam, the AL leader said: \u201cPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina granted Hifazat permission to hold rally in Dhaka. Begum Khaleda Zia, however, took the chance and used Hifazat workers to turn Dhaka into a city of terror and looting.\u201d\r\n \r\n\u201cPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina knows how to stay beside people and countrymen with the love and care of a mother. On that day, she showed how to stay beside people when it comes to the country\u2019s interests and people\u2019s welfare,\u201d he added.","picture":"http:\/\/photos-e.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-frc3\/t1\/970776_468411626580140_553746041_s.jpg"}
