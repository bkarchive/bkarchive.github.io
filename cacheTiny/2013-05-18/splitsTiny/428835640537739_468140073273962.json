Then I started to follow news of the country from him and in other ways too. What frustrates me is how corrupted and overcrowded the country is. But there is a new frustration, 'judicial killings', I would call it. As all the judges have not heard all the evidence (according to THE ECONOMIST), besides the verdict was known back in December. Also the act of the police, it absolutely disgusted me and others too. I have seen a clip of shooting by Bangladeshi police towards protesters, It was very brutal. Bangladesh should deal with its past but in a free and fair way otherwise general people will be affected by it. \n\n - Jessica Hughes"}
