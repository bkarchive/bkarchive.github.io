India has openly displayed its intention to decide political and economic future of Bangladesh through their puppet Hasina. Some power hungry politicians of Awamileague are playing the role of traitor Mir Jafaor to hand over our countries freedom to India. We can not allow this to happen. I can see there is a clear difference of opinion with the USA regarding Indian\u2019s game play in Bangladesh, and we need to be active in twitter and face book to widen this gap. Politics of mind is as important as politics of direct action. Majority media are Awamileagues supported and most probably their editors and proprietors have received huge sums of money from Indian agents to act for them. Today\u2019s arrest of Barrister Moudud, Rafique and MK Anwar of BNP is an attempt to manage them, extract information or threaten them with consequences, though I think Mr Modud has been already compromised, but just to make it unsuspecting, DB police have arrested him with the other two. If Begum Zia remains firm, no conspiracy to divide and rule will work. Indian and their stooge Hasina are desperately trying to divide the 18 party alliances. Recent visit to Singapore, and direct talk with Mahi B chowdhury was part of that plan. But I believe there are patriotic leaders within JP who are vehemently opposing this conspiracy. We need to be more vocal in facebook and twitter, making awareness of the danger of Indian\u2019s rise in south East Asia as a political Hitler.\n\nKeep twitting Obama on this regard. On facebook we should post powerful pictures that highlight India as the new bully and a villain trying to devour Bangladesh. Portray Hasina and her son as Indian appointed Dalal in Bangladesh. \n\nMozafor"}
