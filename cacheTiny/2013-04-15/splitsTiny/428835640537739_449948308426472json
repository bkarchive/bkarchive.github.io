They are licking the feet of the groups that have political and economical power. Dr. Asif Nazrul says about our media\" I lost the last hope for BD that was our media and I feel shame to think that I am a media personal of BD. If we consider The Prothom Alo, few day ago was the most popular news paper in BD published a lot of false news against Jamat-Shibir and in favour of the government and Shahabag and its activits. Today it has published a nasty article about Luckey a very renowned Shahabag activist. The article in one word just makes her naked and raped. But some days ago it published many reports and article praising her. I can remember that four and five years ago it published many reports sparing Jamat and shibir. I can mention another example, N tv and Atn telecated many woyaj (holly lecture) of Allahma Saidee and Abul Kalam Azad but then when the session came to earn money by spreading propaganda against them they just did it shamelessly. Now I am sure that they day will come very soon when these media will suck the feet of Jamat-Shibir In'sallah because this group is growing powerful in politics and economy.\n-\u09ab\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u09a8\u09aa\u09cb\u09b8\u09cd\u099f"}
