A respectable person of society should head the interim government,\u201d the opposition chief said\r\n\r\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina in an address to the nation last week proposed the formation of an all-party interim government and asked the opposition to name their representatives.\r\n\r\nThe BNP chief said Hasina\u2019s proposal of an all-party poll-time government is \u2018disappointing\u2019.\r\n\r\nStating her party\u2019s stand on the proposal, the BNP Chairperson said, \u201cThe nation hoped the Prime Minister\u2019s speech would have something substantial on caretaker government. But everybody is disappointed because there was nothing about it there.\u201d\r\n\r\nKhaleda brushed aside the fusillade of criticism from the government and instead pointed out how the BNP will govern the country if it goes to power.\r\n\r\nAbout the Prime Minister\u2019s speech, she said, \u201cShe has slandered me in her usual ways.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is important to bring back national unity. One must unite for democracy.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are disappointed by their obstinacy, and disrespect towards the people and the opposition,\u201d she fired back.\r\n\r\nKhaleda said the BNP did not announce long-term agitation programmes keeping the people in mind.\r\n\r\n\u201cI still believe all matters can be resolved by discussions,\u201d said the former Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nThe opposition chief began briefing the press at Westin Hotel in Gulshan at 4:10pm. Top leaders of the 18-Party alliance and BNP are present in the press conference.","picture":"https:\/\/fbcdn-photos-a-a.akamaihd.net\/hphotos-ak-prn2\/603129_559520590802576_1274095164_s.jpg"}
