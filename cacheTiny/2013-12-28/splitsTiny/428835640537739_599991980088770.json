This is why this daily has been publishing fantastic reports one after another against Chhatrashibir. The concerned report tried to make bizarre analogy of Chhatrashibir with the banned organization Hijb ut-Tahrir, said that Shibir led the procession of hijbut and 2 of the arrestees were Shibir activists. All these are but some fantasy stories. The report is solely based on reporter\u2019s own assumptions. Indeed, Shibir has not even any remoter connection with Hijb ut-Tahrir or any other organizations. Shibir has been launching its movement in a way that is systematic and peaceful with a view to safeguarding Islam and the country.\u201d\r\n\r\nShibir Secretary-General urged the concerned media and media man to refrain from publishing such false and baseless reports any more.","picture":"http:\/\/photos-d.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-frc3\/1499464_599991766755458_1516008935_s.jpg"}
