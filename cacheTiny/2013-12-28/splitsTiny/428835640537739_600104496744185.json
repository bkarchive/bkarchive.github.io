When a regime becomes more aggressive and violent to subdue the opponents, the democratic state starts to act then as an autocratic rule. Bangladesh is a democratic country which is renowned worldwide for its democratic practice and political coexistence. The constitution of the country also backs the rights of the individual and the party to gather or to hold a procession. Article 37 of the constitution states that, \u201cEvery citizen shall have the right to assemble and to participate in public meetings and processions peacefully and without arms, subject to any reasonable restrictions imposed by law in the interests of public order health.\u201d\nBut the democratic norms and practices of the country have become questionable since the incumbent Awami League government has come to the power. The opposition, not very defiant, has struggled to make broad base movement against the government. But the government is rather further aggressive to crush the opposition. The opposition alliances have to wait for getting the police nod to hold a rally. But the nation has faced a unique experience this time as the government uses its all apparatus including law enforcers and the party cadres to create hindrance against the opposition declared program. An unprecedented strike had been declared by the administration on last 12th March, as the opposition declared a mass gathering in the city on that day. The capital Dhaka was made disconnected from the rest part of the country as the government suspended all the naval and road transportation. The situation was so severe that even I had struggled a lot to come to my office from my home, which is just located in the other part of the capital.\nAs the government is branding the opposition as terrorist forces, so making a u-turn, the leader of the opposition and former Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia has declared \u2018March to Dhaka\u2019 program on 29th December. The announcement of such a program soothed the people as they wanted to get rid of non-stop blockade and strike of the opposition. But that desire of the people have put at a stake once again as the government is adopting the same policy of hindrance this time as well. Furthermore, they are more aggressive in comparison to 12th March to foil the opposition declared demonstration and gathering program.\n\nTransport services on many roads suspended ahead of BNP rally\n\nCommunications of the capital with several districts remained snapped since Friday morning as bus and launch services have been suspended \u201cfearing violence\u201d ahead of the opposition\u2019s March for Democracy towards Dhaka scheduled to be staged on Sunday.\n\nBNP chairperson Khaleda Zia announced the program on December 24 calling upon people from all walks of life to march towards Dhaka carrying the national flag to press home their demands for having the next national election under a non-party neutral administration.\n\nPro-Awami League owners and workers suspended the operation of buses and launches on several routes while many others were \u2018forced\u2019 to stop the services.\n\nIn Rajshahi, transport workers loyal to the ruling party on Friday called a strike on Rajshahi-Dhaka route until Sunday for \u2018security reasons\u2019.\n\nDistrict Motor Workers\u2019 Union enforced the strike at 5pm Friday and it will end on Sunday evening.\n\nBus services of Barisal and other parts of the region were also stopped in the morning.\n\nAftab Hossain, president of Barisal Bus Owners\u2019 Association, said the operation of Dhaka-bound passenger buses from Barisal and other parts of the region were suspended at 11:30 fearing the loss of lives and property through acts of sabotage over the March for Democracy program.\n\nSimilar transport strikes have also been enforced on Sylhet-Dhaka, Meherpur-Dhaka, Bagerhat-Dhaka, Pirojpur-Dhaka, Bhola-Dhaka routes.\n\nLaunch services on various river routes, including Bhola-Sadarghat, Fularhat (Pirojpur)-Sadarghat and Barisal-Sadarghat, also remained snapped.\n\n330 persons held Saturday\n\nThe joint forces, comprised of the police, the Rapid Action Battalion and the Border Guard Bangladesh, picked up at least 330 men from the capital's Tejgaon area, Dhaka-bound trains and two districts on Saturday, police said.\n\nThe detention came just a day ahead of the BNP-led alliance\u2019s \u2018march for democracy\u2019 toward Dhaka to join a rally Sunday.\n\nIn capital, the joint forces held 162 people during their overnight drives carried out at different residences, boarding houses and messes at Tejgaon area, police said.
