Sorrowful that would not be possible in 10th National Election, held on 5 January'2013. It may the first time in #Bangladesh, a autocratic election is going to take place where majority voters will not even have a chance to cast there vote. This is the worst mockery on the sake of democracy, constitution.\r\n Therefore I stand with the citizens of Bangladesh who need the answer....\r\n#WhereIsMyVote? #AmarVoteKoi?\r\n We want #Democracy and we are #AntiAutocracy\r\n So we are going to #BoycottElection that will held \r\n on 5th January to #SaveBangladesh.\r\n\r\nAbdullah Al Asem","picture":"http:\/\/photos-f.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-ash3\/t1\/1545107_603907576363877_891426005_s.jpg"}
