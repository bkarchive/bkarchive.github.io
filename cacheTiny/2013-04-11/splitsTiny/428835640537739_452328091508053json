Bangladeshi laws don't allow behavior deemed to fan sectarian conflict.\n\nAt the weekend, Islamist parties organized a massive counter-protest in Dhaka, the capital, demanding the government bring in anti-blasphemy laws to protect Islam. Police have shot and killed dozens of Islamist protesters in recent weeks.\n\nPolice said Mahmudur Rahman, 59, the editor of the Bengali daily Amar Desh, was arrested from the newspaper office on charges that the daily published stories violating the country's laws.\n\n\"We have arrested him in a case filed against him in December,\" Dhaka police spokesman Masudur Rahman told, adding that he was also accused of publishing false and derogatory information that incited religious tension.\n\nAuthorities said the arrest of Mr. Rahman was meant to stop the worsening of tensions in a society divided between secular and religious communities. His newspaper has been printing the bloggers' material and pointing out that it insults Islam. Attempts to reach Mr. Rahman, who has not been formally charged, were not successful.\n\nHe also faces potential charges over allegations his newspaper republished transcripts in December that purported to show government meddling in the war crimes tribunal. The transcripts - leaked Skype conversations supposedly between the former head of the tribunal and a Bangladeshi lawyer - appeared to show the two men discussing government pressure on them to reach verdicts. A court later proscribed newspapers from carrying the alleged transcripts but Amar Desh continued to do so.\n\nOpposition politicians claim the government is using the tribunal and the recent tensions to clamp down on political opponents. All of the ten people on trial are from opposition parties, eight of them from the Jamaat-e-Islami, the country's leading Islamist group.\n\nOn Monday, police arrested 10 officials from the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party on allegations they have been inciting communal violence by supporting calls for nationwide strikes in recent weeks. Shamsher Chowdhury, vice chairman of the BNP, said the arrests were on \"false and fictitious charges.\"\n\nMs. Hasina's secular-minded Awami league-led government denies political meddling in the tribunal. In recent speeches, Ms. Hasina has said the country will push ahead with the trials, which she says is needed to bring justice to families that lost members.\n\nMahmudur Rahman, who served as a deputy minister for energy in the cabinet led by (BNP) leader Khaleda Zia between 2001 and 2006, bought Amar Desh in 2008. He became its acting editor and made it an opposition mouthpiece.\n\nAmid rising political tensions, strikes and deadly protests, Amar Desh's circulation has increased six-fold in recent months to 200,000 daily and is now one of the most visited Bangladeshi news websites.\n\nhttp:\/\/bdinn.com\/news\/mahmudur-rahman-arrested\/\nSource: Agencies","picture":"https:\/\/fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net\/safe_image.php?d=AQDz1ws9nTuwjXUk&w=130&h=130&url=http%3A%2F%2Fi2.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FI-Fmi8gaFE0%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg%3Ffeature%3Dog","source":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/v\/I-Fmi8gaFE0?autohide=1&version=3&autoplay=1","name":"Prominent Bangladesh news editor arrested amid unrest"}
