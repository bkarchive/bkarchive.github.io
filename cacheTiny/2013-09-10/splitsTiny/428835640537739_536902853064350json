The tribunal awarded him with death penalty in two charges. Jamaat-e-Islami party rejected the verdict as a whole terming it as a government sponsored conspiracy to wipe out the opposition. Along with the party reaction, at least some general people who follow Sayeedi, reacted against that move. Thousands of angry protesters took to the streets and the police fired huge rounds of bullets to foil the demonstration of the protesters. The result was 73 men, women and children died in a single day, just within 8 hours. Most of the deceased were general people and it was one of the deadliest day in Bangladesh\u2019s history since the independence war of 1971.\n\nIn consecutive four days of all out protests occurred throughout the whole country in general and in the western-northern part and southern eastern part in particular. More than 143 protesters were killed by police. Rotten corps of protesters was recovered from ponds and paddy fields during these clashes. Some estimates suggest the figure may be higher. Youtube videos\u2019 captured in hidden camera showed police open fired and killed protesters when they were handcuffed[9]. Around ten thousand people were wounded and many of them died from a critical condition, having barred by police from getting treatment.\nThrough video footage and newspaper report it was revealed that police used firearms disproportionately and indiscriminately. Although Human Rights Watch reported in their statement issued on March 1, 2013, some instances of violence allegedly by the protesters they categorically maintained that \u201cthe police and other security forces have used disproportionate force in some cases, leading to preventable loss of life and further inflaming the situation.\u201d[10]\n\nhttp:\/\/bdinn.com\/news\/bangladesh-bleeding-mass-killing-in-february-2013\/","picture":"https:\/\/fbcdn-photos-c-a.akamaihd.net\/hphotos-ak-ash3\/t1\/1175042_536899969731305_2039801797_s.jpg"}
