The report is totally void of any evidentiary elements and only contains a whole heap of statements of cops and Awami League as well as Chhatra League. It said that about 15 to 20 youths chanting slogan of \u2018Naraye Takbeer\u2019 had bombarded in front of the police in Awami League\u2019s electoral gathering held at Horian area of Poba Upozila in Rajshahi. We do wonder like many others that a prominent daily of the country published an untrue report based on some statements of Chhatra League alone against a disciplined student outfit. No statement of Poba upozila Chhatrashibir leaders has been included in the concerned report. We say with utmost confidence that Shibir has no connection with this incident. Chhatrashibir never believes in politics of violence and bombardment. So, this report cannot be treated as one of any responsible media.\u201d\r\n\r\nShibir Secretary-General further said, \u201cChhatra League cadres chanting slogans of \u2018Naraye Takbeer, Allahu Akbar\u2019 are seen to attack in many places of the country and were also caught red-handed in various places including Bogra while doing so.\u201d\r\n\r\nShibir leaders urged the concerned media and media men to refrain from publishing such false and baseless reports in the days to come and help in bringing the real culprits to book.","picture":"http:\/\/photos-f.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-frc3\/1487363_598635393557762_203747962_s.jpg"}
