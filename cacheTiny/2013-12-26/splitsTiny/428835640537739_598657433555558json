Both reports have been falsely fabricated against Chhatashibir.\r\n\r\nIn a gainsaying statement, the Secretary-General of Bangladesh Islami Chhatrashibir Abdul Zabbar said, \u201cThe Bengali daily Prothom Alo has been concocting false reports one after another against Jamaat-Shibir with a view to hiding crude barbarism committed by joint forces in close collaboration with Awami goons in the name of the so-called \u2018operation\u2019 and also stimulating the same. It artistically accused Chhatrashibir of the so-called attacks on the houses of Awami League leaders and minority community. But the reporter failed to specifically provide any name or address of any Shibir man in this regard. The reporter further said in the report that he just assumed to be so as he couldn\u2019t reach the locale due to obstacles. This sufficiently proves that the concerned report is one purely based on assumptions devoid of any truth.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAccordingly, another Bengali daily \u2018Ittefaq\u2019 published a fantastic report with heading \u2018Jamaat-Shibir will attack the minority in Dinajpur area\u2019 relating Chhatrashibir to attacks on houses of minority, arson and looting. But neither the people aggrieved nor their family members mentioned any name of Jamaat-Shibir men in this context. Even the police official declared that the attackers are unidentified. But, even so, the concerned reporter of the daily Ittefaq made ill attempts to concoct some cock and bull stories to blame Jamaat-Shibir.\u201d\r\n\r\nShibir Secretary-General said, \u201cIt is the illegitimate Awami government, and of course not Jamaat-Shibir, which blockaded the whole country. Recently, it killed about 21 Jamaat-Shibir men inclusive of women, children and the old by joint forces together with its party thugs in many places of the country including Satkhira, Joypurhat, Nilphamari etc. Hundreds of houses were torched and leveled with bulldozers and thousands of cattle were burnt alive. Even the Holy Quran as well as Hadith books and other essential commodities were not left out from the attack. Jamaat-Shibir never attacked on houses of the minority people; rather the Awami goons did. Of late, Jubo League and Chhatra League men were caught red-handed while torching houses of the minority people in many places of the country including Satkhira, Ramu, Feni etc. But the polarized media is busy in fabricating cock and bull stories against Chhatrashibir overlooking the facts cited above. Journalism which slanders those \u2018oppressed\u2019 and saves the oppressors is not positive journalism at all; rather it\u2019s a worst type of yellow journalism.\u201d\r\n\r\nShibir Secretary-General urged the concerned media and media man to put an end to concocting such false and baseless reports.","picture":"https:\/\/fbcdn-photos-a-a.akamaihd.net\/hphotos-ak-prn2\/1526452_598657336888901_2120484193_s.jpg"}
