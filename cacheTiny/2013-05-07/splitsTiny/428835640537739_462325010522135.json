Like wise 6th May, 2013 , middle of the night, inexpressible, worst and the most sad part that the present government did the same things on own nations civilians, mass civilians killing in the middle of the night. Who to blame, where to blame, where to get the justice, come on, now is the time, grow up, pay the debt, see the real story what happen in Bangladesh. We are trying outside to spread the news as soon as possible to overall the country, you guys are there, can save the country InshaAllah!\n\nLubna Yasmin"}
