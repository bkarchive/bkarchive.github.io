Now, where exactly is the government? Gone? Given up? Fallen Asleep? Out to lunch?\r\n\r\nOh wait, the caption on these photos says \u201cBCL cadre\u201d and \u201cex BCL cadre.\u201d So I suppose the correct answer is, government has just handed over duties to freelance gunmen. That is a recipe for stability, I am quite sure. I can see tomorrow\u2019s headlines. BCL shoots BNP. BCL shoots Hifazat. BCL shoots Jamaat. BCL shoots pakhi. Or it, pakhi\u2019r moto gooli. Mone thake na.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I am sure BCL cadres running riot in Chittagong with guns will bring stability to the nation. It worked before, with BCL and JCD, didn\u2019t it?","picture":"https:\/\/fbcdn-photos-c-a.akamaihd.net\/hphotos-ak-ash3\/526648_449580995129870_512931869_s.jpg"}
