Such dramatic poses. It feels like a dramatic film. But sadly, for us, it\u2019s real life.\r\n\r\nOh wait, the caption on these photos says \u201cBCL cadres\u201d  So I suppose the correct answer is, government has just handed over duties to freelance gunmen. That is a recipe for stability, I am quite sure. I can see tomorrow\u2019s headlines. BCL shoots BNP. BCL shoots Hifazat. BCL shoots Jamaat. BCL shoots pakhi. Or it, pakhi\u2019r moto gooli. Mone thake na.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I am sure BCL cadres running riot in Chittagong with guns will bring stability to the nation. It worked before, with BCL and JCD, didn\u2019t it?\r\n\r\nEven worse, these photos ran in Daily Star. Not exactly the most anti-government platform. When even Daily Star is running photos of BCL cadre in gunfight, you know things are very bad indeed.\r\n\r\nI want to wake up from this nightmare. But when I close my eyes, nothing changes.","picture":"http:\/\/photos-f.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-ash3\/524347_449579881796648_706920971_s.jpg"}
