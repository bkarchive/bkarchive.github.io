He was born in Asyut, Egypt. After graduating from college, he was sent to the United States for further studies, and returned as a critic of whatever differed from Isl\u0101m. He joined the Muslim Brotherhood, and was tortured and imprisoned. He was executed in prison in 1387 H.)\r\nHe was offered the world. He was offered the chance to be a minister while he was behind bars, as well as to be the secretary of the Socialist Union, the supervisor of their printing and publishing press, the Ministry of Education, etc. And during his time in prison, he would spend most of his time in the prison clinic, as his body was afflicted with numerous diseases. When one of the officials who loved Isl\u0101m would visit the prison seeking to meet Sayyid, he would require a hot bath \u2013 he would have to sit in the hot water for two hours \u2013 so that he would be able to meet people.\r\nSayyid Qutb was executed, and before his execution, he would repeat his famous statement: \u201cVerily, the index finger that testifies to All\u0101h\u2019s Oneness in the prayer rejects that it be used to write a single letter acknowledging the rule of a tyrant.\u201d\r\nAnd Sayyid Qutb went on to his Lord, and how much was the laughter and tears\u2026To complete the show, they came with one of the scholars to meet him before he went to the hangman\u2019s noose, saying to him: \u201cPart of the procedure of being executed is that you say \u2018I bear witness that none has the right of being worshipped except All\u0101h, and Muhammad (\u0648\ufeb3\ufee0\ufee2 \ufecb\ufee0\ufbff\ufbab \u0627\ufdf2 \ufebb\ufee0\ufef0) is the Messenger of All\u0101h.\u2019 So, say this, Sayyid.\u201d So, Sayyid Qutb looked to him and said: \u201cEven you have come to complete the show? Even you? You eat bread with this phrase, and I am being executed for it!\u201d And Sayyid Qutb was executed in the depths of prison, and to this day, nobody knows where he is buried. One of his friends would often complain to me: \u201cI wish we knew where his grave was, so that we could visit it.\u201d I said to him: \u201cThe Lord of humanity Knows where his grave is. What is the point of you knowing where it is?\u201dSayyid Qutb met his Lord while, throughout his entire life, \u2018F\u012b Dhil\u0101l al-Qur\u2019\u0101n\u2019was only printed once, and in the year that he was executed, it was printed seven times! Seven times\u2026in fact, the Christian printing presses in Beirut, when they were about to go bankrupt, would advise each other: \u201cPrint \u2018adh-Dhil\u0101l,\u2019 and your livelihoods will return to normal.\u201d\r\nFrom \u2018Being True With Allah\u2019 by The Martyred Imam Abdullah Azzam","picture":"http:\/\/photos-a.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-prn1\/t1\/1016158_520661461355156_320683309_s.jpg"}
