He was born in 661 H, and moved to Damascus. He became a very distinguished and famous scholar in both rational and religious sciences. He was an expert in the Qur\u2019anic sciences and Fiqh. He was persecuted and imprisoned for some of his verdicts, and died in prison in 728 H.)\r\nHe gave the fatw\u0101 that three pronouncements of divorce in one sitting constitute only one divorce, in opposition to the opinion the scholars of the four schools of Fiqh. His student, Ibn al-Qayyim, also gave this same fatw\u0101. So, they were placed on a camel, and were paraded around Damascus, and the fools mocked them, and the children would follow behind them and call out, clap, and humiliate them.\r\nIbn Taymiyyah was thrown into prison, and in \u2018al-Fat\u0101w\u0101\u2019, he said: \u201cI would provide for some families before I was put in prison, and when I was imprisoned, this aide was cut off to these poor families. So, I was extremely pained at this, and the news would come to me from these families while I was in prison: \u201cYou still come to us in the same physical form, and you pay us the same amount that you used to give us.\u201d So, our brothers from the jinn are stepping up to take over from what we used to do. If the Earth is empty of anyone to do good, the world of the believing jinn and Angels are with the believer.\u201d\r\nAnd Ibn Taymiyyah said his famous saying: \u201cWhat can my enemies do to me? My paradise and garden are in my chest, and do not leave me. My imprisonment is seclusion with All\u0101h, and my death is martyrdom, and my expulsion is tourism. If the people who imprisoned me were given the equivalent of this prison in gold, it would not do them as much good as what All\u0101h has given me with this prison.\u201d And Ibn Taymiyyah died, and some of his writings were taken from the prison after he was prevented from having a pen and paper. So, he would take stones and rocks from the prison walls and floor, and he would write on the walls. So, these writings were copied down and his books were burned up, and the tyrants thought that they had put out the light of this scholar, and had prevented his teachings from reaching the people.\r\nTime went on, and after an entire six and a half centuries, All\u0101h caused oil to be discovered in the Arabian Peninsula. Those with whom the oil was discovered, their scholars were nurtured upon the books of Ibn Taymiyyah. And with this immense amount of wealth, every single word that Ibn Taymiyyah ever wrote was printed and distributed to every corner of the globe. So, you will hardly find a library on Earth except that it has one or more books by Ibn Taymiyyah. And which scholar on Earth today is more well-known to the Muslims than Shaykh alIsl\u0101m Ibn Taymiyyah? After six centuries! It is the amazing sincerity and truthfulness that All\u0101h turns into a good reputation and remembrance on the Earth, as a form of glad tiding and welcoming from the Heavens.\r\nFrom \u2018Being True With Allah\u2019 by The Martyred Imam Abdullah Azzam","picture":"https:\/\/fbcdn-photos-e-a.akamaihd.net\/hphotos-ak-prn2\/971244_520651904689445_1047952686_s.jpg"}
