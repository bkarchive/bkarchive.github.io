The moment of joy comes this year with the gloomy cloud of Shut Down (Temporary). Our path of Truth and Elegance is now closed with unexpected bars when Diganta was in remarkable position among the television viewers in home and abroad . We'll be happy to welcome you from 10am to 5pm. We expect you to encourage us during this special moment. Thanks for your continuous support and encouragement.\r\nRegards\r\nMojibur Rahman Monju\r\nDED\r\nDiganta Television.","picture":"http:\/\/photos-f.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-frc1\/1001944_529946613759974_1535490623_s.jpg"}
