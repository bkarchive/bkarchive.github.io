He was of the jinn and departed from the command of his Lord. Then will you take him and his descendants as allies other than Me while they are enemies to you? Wretched it is for the wrongdoers as an exchange.\u275e (18:50)\n\n\u2726So how do we survive these trials?\u2726\n(solutions can be found in surah al-kahf too)\n\n1) Sincerity \n\n\u275d Say, \"I am only a man like you, to whom has been revealed that your god is one God. So whoever would hope for the meeting with his Lord - let him do righteous work and not associate in the worship of his Lord anyone.\u275e (18:110)\n\n2) Calling to Allah \n\n\u275d And recite, [O Muhammad], what has been revealed to you of the Book of your Lord. There is no changer of His words, and never will you find in other than Him a refuge.\u275e (18:27)"}
