The police deny it. His family have looked for him at local police stations without success. He is at risk of torture or extrajudicial execution.\nAnwarul Islam Masum is a university student and Rajshahi City Office Secretary of Bangladesh Islami Chhatra Shibir (BICS), the student wing of the opposition political party Jamaat-e-Islami. According to members of his family, in the early hours of 4 April, 30-40 officers from the Bangladesh Police and the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), a special police force implicated in hundreds of killings, raided Anwarul Islam Masum\u2019s home in Rajshahi and\nabducted him. Family members told Amnesty International they were not allowed to leave the house during the raid, so did not see where he was being taken. Neighbours told them they had seen the officers putting Anwarul Islam Masum inside a vehicle with RAB markings and take him away.\n\nAnwarul Islam Masum was abducted a few days after violent clashes between supporters of BICS and police. According to local media, a number of protesters and several policemen were injured in the clashes. Bangladeshi TV stations showed people they said were BICS supporters singling out a policeman in the street, and beating him repeatedly until he collapsed. Following the abduction, Anwarul Islam Masum\u2019s family went to look for him at the local police station. Police said they had no knowledge of him being detained. The family then tried to register a formal report of his abduction, but the police refused to do so. The family also visited the local RAB headquarters; RAB also denied that they had detained him. In response to a petition Anwarul Islam Masum\u2019s mother submitted in early June, the High Court\nordered the Bangladesh authorities, including the Secretary of the Home Ministry, the Inspector General of Police and the Director General of the RAB to explain within three weeks why Anwarul Islam Masum could not be produced before the court.\n\nPlease write immediately in Bangla, English, or your own language:\n\nCalling on the authorities to launch an immediate investigation into the alleged abduction of Anwarul Islam Masum, publish the results and bring those responsible to justice;\nUrging the authorities to ensure that Anwarul Islam Masum will not be tortured or otherwise ill-treated should he be found to be in the custody of the authorities;\n\nUrging the authorities to ensure that, if it is established that Anwarul Islam Masum is detained by the authorities, that he be released unless he is charged with a recognizably criminal offence.\nPLEASE SEND APPEALS BEFORE 26 JULY 2013 TO:\nMinister of Home Affairs\nMuhiuddin Khan Alamgir\nMinistry of Home Affairs\nH-16, R-25, B-A, Banani\nDhaka-1213, Bangladesh\nFax: +880 2 7164788 (keep trying)\nEmail: mkalamgir@yahoo.com\nminister@mha.gov.bd\nSalutation:\nDear Home Minister\nInspector General of Police\nMr Hassan Mahmud Khandker\nBangladesh Police HQ\nDhaka-1000, Bangladesh\nFax: +880 2 7125840\nEmail: ig@police.gov.bd\nSalutation:\nDear Inspector General\nAnd copies to\n:\nPrime Minister\nSheikh Hasina, Prime Minister's Office\nOld Sangsad Bhaban\nTejgaon, Dhaka-1215, Bangladesh\nFax: +880 2 811 3244\nEmail: pm@pmo.gov.bd\nps1topm@pmo.gov.bd\npsecy@pmo.gov.bd\nPlease check with your section office if sending appeals after the above date.\n\nURGENT ACTION\nOPPOSITION ACTIVIST ABDUCTED IN BANGLADESH\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nReports of enforced disappearances have frequently surfaced in the Bangladeshi media in recent years. Bangladeshi human\nrights organizations have investigated and reported on dozens of such cases. In 2012 alone, Amnesty International received\ncredible allegations that at least 10 people had been subjected to enforced disappearance. Most abductions are carried out by people in civilian clothes who tell witnesses they are from the security forces. Nothing is then heard about the people abducted, who have all so far been men. In some cases, usually when there was no witness to the abduction, the body of the victim is found some distance from where he was abducted. Most of those abducted appear to be members of opposition parties, but people with no political affiliation have also been abducted. The pattern of official responses appears to reinforce families\u2019 suspicions that police have been responsible for the abductions. Police have denied that they have been involved but they have also persistently failed to disclose what they have done to establish what has happened, and who was responsible for the abductions. There has been no news of a credible investigation by the police into any enforced disappearance.\n\nFor example, trade union leader Aminul Islam went missing on 4 April 2012. He was found dead a day later in Ghatail town,\nnorth of Dhaka. His family saw evidence of torture on his body and believe he had been abducted by the security forces. He had\npreviously been arrested and beaten by members of the National Security Intelligence for his trade union activities.\n\nAmnesty International has also issued an Urgent Action in response to a similar recent case. On12 April Nazrul Islam, Joypurhat district secretary of Jamaat-e-Islami, was allegedly abducted from his home in Saheb Parha in Joypurhat district, northern Bangladesh. His abductors identified themselves to Nazrul Islam\u2019s family as being \u201cfrom the administration\u201d. He has not been seen or heard from since. There are fears he has been taken to an unknown location and is at risk of torture and extrajudicial execution. https:\/\/www.amnesty.org\/en\/library\/info\/ASA13\/008\/2013\/en\nName: Anwarul Islam Masum\nGender m\/f: M\nUA: 154\/13 Index: ASA 13\/010\/2013 Issue Date: 14 June 201\n\nhttp:\/\/www.amnesty.org\/en\/library\/asset\/ASA13\/010\/2013\/en\/c7b23c1f-cee4-4034-a49f-81c68c92d359\/asa130102013en.pdf"}
