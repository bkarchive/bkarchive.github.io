We offer our heartfelt felicitations to the newly elected Mayors. This ballot revolution exactly showed people\u2019s antipathy towards the oppressive Awami government. This victory connotes the triumph of people\u2019s will against the ill governance of the current regime\u201d.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe City Corporation polls proved people\u2019s stand is against the Baksal-attitudinal government. People strongly longs for the reinstatement of the scrapped caretaker government. Any anti-Islam enterprise is sure to be foiled in this country wherein about 90 percent of its nationals are Muslims. Hopefully, the government will undertake its next step with care considering the sentiment of the masses\u201d.\n\nShibir Secretary-General prayed unto Allah for the betterment of the newly-elected Mayors so that they can serve the nation by discharging their functions properly."}
