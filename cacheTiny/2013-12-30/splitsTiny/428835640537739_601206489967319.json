The report is totally void of any evidentiary elements and said, based on the statement of Mohammadpur Thana O.C. Azizul Hoque alone, that 2 hundred bombs had been seized by cops from a mess of Shibir at Mohammadpur in the capital. The reports also spoke about arrest of 3 Shibir activists in that regard. But, interestingly, in Mohammadpur\u2019s Rajia Sultana road wherein the incident took place, there is no mess of Chhatrashibir. Eevn no single statement of Mohammadpur Thana Chhatrashibir leaders has been included in the said reports. We\u2019d like to confidently say that Chhatrashibir has even no remoter connection with this incident and none of the arrestees belongs to Chhatrashibir. We believe that such reporting can in no way be treated as positive journalism; rather, we think it\u2019s a part of pro-government agenda.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe leaders urged the concerned media and media men not to publish such false and baseless reports furthermore.","picture":"http:\/\/photos-g.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-prn2\/1484255_601206379967330_1583437672_s.jpg"}
