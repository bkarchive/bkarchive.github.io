The Opposition men, especially Shibir leaders and activists, inclusive of even ordinary mortals are being nabbed though no definite charges are against them. The acts of wholesale arrest, vandalism, oppression etc which are being committed now-a-days by the joint forces ordered by the government are sheer violation of human rights. The government surpassed all the track record of human rights violation by launching vandalism with the help of joint forces gradually in various districts of the country. Over 2 hundred Shibir men have been arrested countrywide. The government transformed the whole country into a \u2018prison\u2019 by launching illegal arrest enterprise.\u201d\r\n\r\nShibir Secretary-General urged the government to step aside from power stopping the massive arrest agenda currently in progress.","picture":"http:\/\/photos-d.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-frc3\/1503320_601241323297169_1688451106_s.jpg"}
