ONLY 300 PEOPLE ATTENDED.\n\nThe grand rally begun at 10:30 am by a group of 8\/10 people then by 2:30 pm only 200 people gathered when Maulana Farid Uddin Masud came to stage to make his speech calling for the ban of Jamati islam. By 4:00 pm only 300 people were present. The program is due to finish by 5:00Pm.\n\nPeople of Bangladesh rejected hypocricy of Maulana Farid uddin Masud for his support of Shabag Nastik. In spite of heavy police protection and 2 kilometre of cordon, the rally failed to attract people in spite of government support and sponsor. This has proven how much these bondo are away from public support and islamic teachings."}
