Nobody knows where she is now. I have seen Zakia Apu(sister) and her family from very close distance because we are very cloze neighbors of them. I have hardly seen such good and cordial men like them. There was no TV set in there house till 2008. It is from this concept that if there was TV in there house then they would be sinners by watching various serial. They did not take the connection of satellite channel until 2011. Even many cable operators wanted to give them free connection but they did not take. Zakis\u2019s younger sister is my batch mate. Whenever we meet her (younger sister of Zakia) in road or other places we did not see any odd behavior like other ten girls. Zakia apu was the second girl of Mosjid Mission School and her best friend Fahmida was the first girl of the same school. In a longer period of time in our past remaining very cloze to them we did not get any sorrows from them by their behavior or activities. But today their life is faced with a great threat. What a condition of our political situation. Did our fathers, uncles or grand fathers fight in liberation war for it? I am not involved to politics and do not understand it so deeply. So now it is request to all of you, now you guys judge it where we are now.\n\nGot from ID, Sopner Valobasa \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\n\n(translated by brother Azizul Haque)"}
