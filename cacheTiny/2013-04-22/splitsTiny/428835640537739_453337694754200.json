It has create concern in many countries and it hurts too much. \nMy heartfelt condolences for those lost their life, I have cried few occasion praying to Allah(swt) for help that's what I can do most staying out of my country.\nI like to pull everyone's attention, such riot\/fight\/genocide will occur when something need to be changed. Remember there were no Muslim in Denmark before the notorious cartoon of Muhammad(SAW), many started to convert to Islam in Denmark for that incident, Americans started to convert to Islam after fall of twin tower.\nAnti Islamist try to push down Islam but the results goes against them, and it favor Islam. I can smell similarities in recent Bangladesh's case and I feel Bangladesh is in purification process of Islam.\nThey plan but the best of planner is Allah(SWT), do not lose hope keep fighting for Islam, at the end Islam will be victorious.\n-Fan Post"}
