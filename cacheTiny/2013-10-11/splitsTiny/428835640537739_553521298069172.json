Found a cunning idea to portray Jamaat-Shibir as extremists in the international arena. They tried to justifying this horrible killing of Bangladesh Police.\n\nDaily Star's Headline was : ''Shibir men attack puja mandap''. \nThey mentioned about 1 killing in a small headline. This clearly shows their intention. They wanted to highlighted the attack. Whereas killing by the police was less important to them.\n\nhttp:\/\/bdyellowmedia.blogspot.co.uk\/"}
