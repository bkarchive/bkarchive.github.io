Hefazat burnt Quran, Hefazat took bribe, Hefazt brought all young boys giving them money\u2026.. and many more. Very soon, you will see video documentaries that will link Hefazat with Laden, Al Qayeda, Horkatul Jihad. Allama Shafi wants to be a minister. He was a razakar. Barrister Tania Ameer now became mufassire quran and gave a fatwa that Allama Shafi defamed Allah in his book. \n\nAlas! In the country where Dr. Younus is \u201cGoriber Rokto Chosha\u201d and Abul Hossain is the \u201cDesh Premik\u201d it is obvious that Hefazat is the top terror and Chatroleague is innocent!!! Come on mate don\u2019t get upset, don\u2019t debate with them. We have lot more to see. \n\nHaven\u2019t you seen after Shagor-Runi\u2019s murder, how they assassinated their character? Didn\u2019t you see after killing 57 army officers at Pilkhana, initially they tried to blame Gen. Shakil and all officers for oppressing innocent BDR jawans and made killer DAD Towhid the BDR chief? Didn\u2019t you see after killing 175 Jamaat-e-Islami activists they blamed Jamaat for burning hindu temples, attacking minorities?\n\nThese are very common strategies for all fascist rulers. Whatever you say, I salute Awami League they have shown what Bangladeshi new generation have never seen before. \n\n-Fanpost"}
