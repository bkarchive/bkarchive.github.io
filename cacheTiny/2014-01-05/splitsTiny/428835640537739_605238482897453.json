Scores have died in the run-up to the polls.\n\nDozens of polling stations have been torched and voting is suspended at more than 100. Polling is said to be thin.\n\nThe opposition is boycotting the vote with a two-day strike against what it called a \"scandalous farce\".\n\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League is assured of victory, with government candidates already declared victors by default in many seats.\n\nShe rejected demands for her to step down and a neutral government to oversee the poll, as in previous years.\n\nBitter enemies\n\"The polls opened across the country at 08:00 (02:00 GMT),\" said election commission spokesman SM Asaduzzaman. Voting will continue until 16:00.\n\nIn more than half of constituencies there is no voting at all, because the opposition boycott has led to government candidates being declared winners in advance.\n\nPolice opened fire as protesters tried to take over polling station in northern Rangpur district, killing three people.\n\nIn Nilphamari district, police also fired on about two dozen protesters. One person died.\n\nIn the opposition stronghold of Bogra, the police chief told AFP: \"We've seen thousands of protesters attack polling booths and our personnel at a number of locations with Molotov cocktails and petrol bombs.\"\n\nVoting was said to be thin in the early hours of the election\nSecurity is tight across the country\nMedia reported that more than 100 polling stations were torched overnight - adding to a similar number the night before.\n\nOne Dhaka resident who refused to vote, Aminul Islam, told the Associated Press: \"We never expected such an election. For such a situation both the government and opposition are responsible. They don't want to establish democracy.\"\n\nOne polling station in Dhaka's Mirpur district recorded only 25 ballots out of 24,000 registered voters in the first two hours, AP reported.\n\nSecurity is tight, with some 50,000 troops reportedly deployed around the country for the election period.\n\nThe opposition Bangladesh National Party (BNP) began a nationwide 48-hour strike on Saturday a day after its leader Khaleda Zia urged supporters to \"completely boycott\" what she called a \"scandalous farce\" of an election.\n\nShe accused the government of placing her under house arrest - something the authorities deny.\n\nNot in doubt\nThe strike is only the latest in a string of protests by the BNP and its allies - including the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami party - that has seen a blockade of roads, railways and waterways and the closure of shops, schools and offices.\n\nIn the run-up to the polls, scores of opposition supporters died in police shootings and dozens of commuters were burnt to death by protesters throwing petrol bombs at strike-defying buses.\n\nThe US and the EU have refused to send observers, further raising questions over the electoral process, correspondents say.\n\nAll elections since 1991 have been held under a neutral caretaker administration to ensure that voting is not fixed.\n\nBut the Awami League abolished the caretaker system in 2010, arguing that it was no longer necessary. It used its two-thirds majority in parliament to make the change.\n\nA special envoy of UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon came to Dhaka last month with the aim of getting the two sides to talk to each other but the dialogue never got off the ground.\n\nThe government has insisted that the BNP should take part in the polls within the existing constitutional framework. It says that the opposition should discuss any changes it wants after the vote.\n\nSheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia - who are bitter political enemies - have alternated from government to opposition for most of the past two decades.","picture":"http:\/\/photos-c.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-ash3\/t1\/1501771_605238429564125_1777910939_s.jpg"}
