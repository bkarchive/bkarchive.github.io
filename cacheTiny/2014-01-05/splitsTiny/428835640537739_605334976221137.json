Around 150 people were killed in the run-up to the vote and tens of thousands of troops have been deployed across the country ahead \nof the vote.\n\nVoting will remain open for eight hours on Sunday, starting at 8am local time (0200 GMT). A huge security operation involving 50,000 troops has been mounted to oversee the vote.\n\nThe vote is boycotted by the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), which urged voters to stay away from the \"farcical\" election, and shunned by international observers.\n\n\"These elections are in no way going to help resolve the stalemate we have seen in the past few months,\" said Iftekhar Zaman, executive director of global anti-corruption body Transparency International in Bangladesh.\n\n\"The parliament which will emerge will be one without an opposition, and so there will be a very big legitimacy crisis,\" he said.","picture":"http:\/\/vthumb.ak.fbcdn.net\/hvthumb-ak-prn2\/t15\/1541970_605336849554283_605334976221137_27452_270_b.jpg","source":"http:\/\/video.ak.fbcdn.net\/hvideo-ak-frc1\/v\/752690_605336749554293_46324091_n.mp4?oh=341c418babad1bdeb4954712e350f5dc&oe=52D84CA2&__gda__=1389903052_3e1941069ff9798fba749f0929478eda","name":"Aljazeera News air today  election :"}
