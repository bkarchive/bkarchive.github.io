Shibir men underwent bars, trials and tribulations from the cops pro-Awami thugs while launching these demos and protests. Policemen arrested at least 38 Shibirmen today and left over 45 more injured and shot.\r\n\r\nShibir leaders said while carrying out today\u2019s program, \u201cThe illegitimate Awami government which is mass-condemned within the border and beyond is currently committing mass killing, arson, looting, rape and political persecution by strewing personnel of RAB, Police and BGB together with its pro-party goons on the civilians. Even the women, children and the old are not having a narrow escape from their attacks. Detached from the masses, the Awami government has perhaps waged a war against the people. We\u2019d like to warn the government that protesting countrymen will go for pre-emptive measures if armed persecution continues upon the unarmed civilians. The illegitimate oppressive Awami government will not finally survive despite its mass killing, rape and extreme persecution.\u201d\r\n\r\nDifferent units of Islami Chhatrashibir partook in today\u2019s countrywide blockade program and successfully discharged their duties and responsibilities with utmost sincerity, bravery and manhood. Of all concerned in this regard, Units of Dhaka Metropolitan City East, Dhaka Metropolitan City South, Dhaka Metropolitan City North, Dhaka College, Rangpur Metropolitan City, Chittagong Metropolitan City North, Chapainababgonj Town, Islamic University, Kurigram District, Lalmonirhat District, Comilla District South and Shibgonj Upozila are noteworthy.","picture":"https:\/\/fbcdn-photos-e-a.akamaihd.net\/hphotos-ak-ash3\/1503932_594299537324681_929120783_s.jpg"}
