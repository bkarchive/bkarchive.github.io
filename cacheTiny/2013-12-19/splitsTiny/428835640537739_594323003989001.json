They never accepted the way of appeasing the autocratic rulers. Never did they become any foot-licking slaves. They always held their heads up high and voiced the truth. They sang the song of justice and freedom. Just for this reason, they always faced harassment and oppression from the state. Through such struggle and self sacrifice, they set shining examples of inspiration and spirit.\n\nThis video features Hazrat Khubayb RA, Omar Mukhtar, Imam Hasan al Banna, Saiyed Qutub Shaheed & Abdul Quader Mullah.\n\nThe tyrant regime and its supporters are celebrating this barbaric injustice like animals. They want to extinguish the light of truth with a single blow. But throughout the ages this light of truth had been kept alight by enlightened people, even by sacrificing their lives. Their only goal is the martyrdom. Like the Bengali national poet Nazrul Islam says, \"Let them go for the life of slavery, but we want the martyrdom; They are always afraid of death, but we search for the death!\"\nhttp:\/\/youtu.be\/IpDfGgPAZXQ","picture":"http:\/\/vthumb.ak.fbcdn.net\/hvthumb-ak-ash3\/1394607_594342360653732_594323003989001_64429_1206_b.jpg","source":"http:\/\/video.ak.fbcdn.net\/hvideo-ak-prn2\/v\/t42\/1226500_594342083987093_20972520_n.mp4?oh=09ae8c5efadf7532d74cf6eb54053244&oe=52D86F46&__gda__=1389899134_d90b050766bb636702bb77ecf637517c","name":"Sacrifices of Islamists throughout the ages : Martyrdom"}
