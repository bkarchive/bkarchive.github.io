Abdul Alim, an octogenarian politician and former minister is the eighth such person to be so convicted. Unlike most of his predecessors, he escaped the death penalty on grounds of age and poor health.\n\nThe tribunal in Dhaka found him guilty of nine charges and observed that death by hanging was the proper punishment for him but has commuted his sentence to \"imprisonment till death\". The family of Mr Alim's rejected the verdict - terming it unfair, improper and politically motivated. His party, the Bangladesh National Party, reserved their reaction though a stalwart of the party and former Mayor of Dhaka criticised the judgment.\n\nMore at:\nhttp:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/indepth\/opinion\/2013\/10\/politicalisation-bangladesh-war-crimes-tribunal-20131011121449114453.html"}
