I will never respect those who come to power through military coups.\"\r\nTurkey's World Bulletin site reported that Erdogan raised the Rabaa Al Adawiya four fingers symbol during the opening ceremony of sports facilities in Trabzon city, north- east Turkey while stressing his commitment to supporting legitimacy in Egypt. Erdogan is reported to have told his supporters \"Let our place here be a symbol of Rabea Al Adawiya Square. Here is Al Adawiya Station and here is the square. \"\r\nErdogan told reporters: \"We have taken similar action to the coup's action against our ambassador. Our position is not directed against the Egyptian people but only against the coup regime. We support the struggle for democracy in the world. And we sincerely respect those who respect the will of the people. We have retaliated against the Egyptian move and gave the Egyptian ambassador and charge d'affaires until November 29th to leave Turkey. \"","picture":"https:\/\/fbcdn-photos-e-a.akamaihd.net\/hphotos-ak-prn2\/1425698_579440625477239_138556413_s.jpg"}
