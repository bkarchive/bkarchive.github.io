Behave like a female, i.e. all the tenderness of a female\u2013a man doesn\u2019t want a man for his wife!\n\n2. Dress pleasantly\/ attractively. If you are a home-maker, don\u2019t stay in your pyjamas suit all day.\n\n3. Don\u2019t lay out all your problems on your husband as soon as he walks in. Give him a little mental break.\n\n4. Be kind to your mother-in-law the same way you would like your husband to be kind to your own mother. (Not ALL in laws are bad)\n\n5. Compliment him on the things you know he\u2019s not so confident about (looks, intelligence, etc.) This will build his self-esteem.\n\n6. Tell your husband you love him, many, many times. Aisha (\u0631\u0636\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0646\u0647\u0627) narrated that the Prophet (\u0635\u0644\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645) used to ask her how strong her love for him, she said like \u201ca knot.\u201d And the next time he would ask her, \u201cHow is that knot?\u201d He also used to reply to her saying, \u201cJazzakillah, O Aishah, wallahi, you have not rejoiced in me as I have rejoiced in you.\u201d.\n\n7. Call his family often.\n\n8. Give him a simple task to do at home and then thank him when he does it. This will encourage him to do more.\n\n9. Encourage him to do good deeds.\n\n10. If he\u2019s in a bad mood, give him some space. He\u2019ll get over it, Insha\u2019Allah.\n\n11. Thank him sincerely for providing you with food and shelter. It\u2019s a big deal.\n\n12. Remember that your husband has feelings, so take them into consideration.\n\n13. If your husband is annoyed over a little thing you do (and you can control it), then stop doing it. Really.\n\n14. Do all of the above fee sabeelillah and you will see Allah put barakah in everything you do.\n\nMay Allah Bring Prosperity. Ameen"}
