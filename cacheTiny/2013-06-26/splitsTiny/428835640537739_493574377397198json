Myanmar army forces allegedly provided the fanatics containers of petrol for torching the houses of Muslim villagers, who were then forced to flee.\r\n\r\nMyanmar\u2019s government has been accused of failing to protect the Muslim minority.\r\n\r\nMyanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi has also come under fire for her stance on the violence. The Nobel Peace laureate has refused to censure the Myanmar military for its persecution of the Rohingyas, although she recently condemned the decision by local officials in Rakhine state to enforce a two-child policy on Rohingya Muslims.\r\n\r\nAmnesty International and Human Rights Watch have issued separate statements, calling on Myanmar to take action to protect the Rohingya Muslim population against extremists.","picture":"https:\/\/fbcdn-photos-d-a.akamaihd.net\/hphotos-ak-frc3\/1000786_493574357397200_304530675_s.jpg"}
