And over the years, the crisis has deepened more. That\u2019s why we can\u2019t think of participating in the upcoming general elections without caretaker government,\u201d said Hossain.\r\n \r\nThis came as he was speaking at a discussion at national press club in Dhaka Wednesday.\r\n \r\n\u201cCity polls and national elections aren\u2019t identical. At present, people have only one demand and that is restoration of caretaker government. They want to elect their desired government by exercising their voting rights through a level playing field,\u201d he said.\r\n \r\n\u201cAbusive and foul unpleasant words are being uttered in the parliament because of the prime minister\u2019s provocation. These obnoxious words are used in a planned way to make the parliament ineffective,\u201d added the BNP leader.","picture":"http:\/\/photos-g.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-frc1\/1013526_493581567396479_124726926_s.jpg"}
