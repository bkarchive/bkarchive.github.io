He had been staying in a villa owned by a businessman with Brotherhood links.\n\nThe officials spoke Thursday on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. Ousted President Mohammed Morsi hails from the Brotherhood, of which he was a longtime leader.\n\nBadie is on a wanted list of more than 200 Brotherhood officials and leaders of other Islamist groups.\n\n[AP]"}
