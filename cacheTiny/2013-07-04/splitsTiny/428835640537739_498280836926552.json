The channel\u2019s managing director Ayman Gaballah and broadcast engineer Ahmad Hasan remain in custody however.\n\nAt the same time, Al Jazeera Arabic\u2019s bureau was raided by the authorities. The network has said their confiscated broadcast equipment must now be returned.\n\nIn the latest development, Associated Press Television News was ordered to deny Al Jazeera channels access to their footage. Cairo News Company (CNC) has also been told to withhold access to broadcast equipment such as SNGs.\n\nMostefa Souag, acting Director General of Al Jazeera Media Network, condemned the moves:\n\n\"Ayman and Ahmad must be released unharmed immediately. We are seeking urgent clarity on the status of other members of our staff. Media offices should not be subject to raids, and journalists should not be detained for informing the public.\n\n\"There are big events taking place in Egypt and the world tunes in to Al Jazeera at times like these. The viewing public will not accept being cut-off from news and information. Regardless of political views, the Egyptian people expect media freedoms to be respected and upheld.\n\n\"We are grateful to all the media organisations giving us their support on these matters.\n\n\"Al Jazeera has reported comprehensively in Egypt since its establishment in 1996, even in difficult circumstances. We will continue to do that with our usual approach of encompassing all opinions with accuracy, balance and fairness.\""}
