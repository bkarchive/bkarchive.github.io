About Socrates many still question why would a seventy-year-old philosopher named Socrates be put to death for what he was teaching? \"What could Socrates have said or done than prompted a jury of 500 Athenians to send him to his death just a few years before he would have died naturally?\"In the same vain, why would a Dhaka court put Kader Molla, an educator and journalist to death on flimsy charges. \r\n\r\nFinding an answer to the mystery of the Socrates's trial is complicated by the fact that Socrates' account comes from ancient Athens and directly from Plato. Kader Mollah's however from his own accounts.\r\n\r\nDespite the differences in the two contexts, the parallels between Socrates and Molla are that the decisions to prosecute and ultimately convict Socrates had a lot to do with the turbulent history of Athens in the several years preceding his trial and about Kader Molla's is the turbulent history of Bangladesh during and after the war of independence of the country led by blood thirsty rulers. True, an examination of that history may provide important clues for the latter.\r\n\r\nSocrates \"discussed moral questions in the workshops and the marketplace.\" Often his unpopular views, expressed disdainfully and with an air of condescension, provoked his listeners to anger. Laertius wrote that \"men set upon him with their fists or tore his hair out,\" but that Socrates \"bore all this ill-usage patiently.\" Molla as a journalist also expressed his views using the media.\r\n\r\nHasina, the leader of the executioners, a cruel and inhumane woman determined to remake Bangladesh to her own pro Indian mold whatever the human cost was. She initially begged to the countrymen to forgive her for the BKSALI misdeeds but once in power found Molla the executive editor of the pro Bangladesh Sangram newspaper and the owner of several powerful news media chose Molla a fitting target for the closure of war crimes.\r\n\r\nSocrates was found guilty of corrupting the youth. The penalty demanded is death. Molla's influence came to be seen as a dangerous and alarming influence, a breeder of anti- Indian politics in Bangladesh. The corrupt Awami court in Dhaka framed Molla in an unrelated case of murder alleged his link to a criminal act during the war. The alleged crime was committed 40 years before the trial when the sole witness in the case was only a minor. In the scheduled last testimony by this witness now an adult, she was not allowed to appear, in her place, the trial court took a fake woman in complete face cover as the witness.\r\n\r\nIn this Dhaka drama by Hasina appointed court, it became clear to the populace and international community that Hasina, autocratic ruler was raised in the notorious Sheikh household of BBKSALI tyranny with her Kamal, Jamal siblings, fall into some disgraceful propensity and surely went far in the career of vice, approved the death by hanging of Kader Molla.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't commit any crime. I was wrongfully condemned to death.\" Molla the respectable Dhaka based reporter claimed in his last letter to his wife. In this letter he also wrote:\r\n\r\n\"Awami League will not be able to stop the atrocities committed on innocent anti Indian Bangladeshis because they came to power by India's help. The Awami cadres appointed judges are now in the role of executioners. Today they are killing innocent people like me.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Athenian democracy, Socrates was allowed to defend himself. Accounts of the three-hour speech (apologia) by Socrates in his defense existed...\". But in Hasina's Molla hearing in Dhaka of 2013 AD, done with utmost secrecy, and rush Molla was not allowed to defend himself. He wrote:\r\n\r\n\"I feel discontented that I couldn't inform my countrymen that I was wrongfully tried and was given death sentence for another person's crimes.\"\r\n\r\nWhat is strikingly present in both Socrates and Molla's trials that in Socrates case asking for clemency was seen by him as unmanly and a disgrace. For \"Socrates was ready to die,\" so was Kader Molla. Like Socrates, Molla was an unrepentant defendant. \"Under Athenian law, execution was accomplished by drinking a cup of poisoned hemlock. Molla was hanged until death. \r\n\r\nThe other parallels in this two trials: Finally, as Socrates is being led off to jail, Socrates utters the memorable line: \"The hour of departure has arrived, and we go our ways--I to die, and you to live. Which to the better fate is known only to God.\" \r\n\r\nLike Socrates, Molla however, uttered the last memorable words. He talks about the state of Bangladesh politics in his last letter to his wife: \r\n\r\n\"I said it from the beginning that the steps the present government is taking were drawn by India.\"\r\n\r\nIn the above, he seems to point out the reasons for horrors brought about by the BKSAL tyrants directly to India. This revaluation surely directs Bangladeshis to look at Molla in a new light. He also sees his death as a murder which to him should help to inspire a two fold struggle: One to fight against the Awami legacy of tyrannical governments and their Indian puppetry and second, against the Indian hegemony in Bangladesh. Like Socrates, Molla's death doesn't seem to diminish him at all.\r\n\r\nThe trial and execution of Kader Molla in 2013 puzzles historians and political analyst as well asking why Bangladesh had to remain so backward even behind the classical Athenians. Prominently, Molla was not allowed to defend himself. Which made Hasina ruled Bangladeshi justice system of 2013 to suffer mightily.\r\n\r\nMolla concludes his letter by saying goodbye to his wife this time like Socrates and forever, now perhaps with tears in his eyes: \"Pairy, hay pairy!\" (My love, oh my love!) \"I couldn't do many things for you to make you happy. Please forgive me. But I wish to meet you again. If God pleases, I will meet you again at the gate of heaven!\"\r\n\r\nIf Molla didn't commit any war crime; at least he claimed his innocence and it is understandable because he wasn't allowed to defend himself, then, is he a 21st century Bangladeshi like 2009 BCE's Socrates of Athens, a martyr for free speech against tyrannical regimes?","picture":"https:\/\/fbcdn-photos-d-a.akamaihd.net\/hphotos-ak-ash3\/523487_593294287425206_1356561482_s.jpg"}
