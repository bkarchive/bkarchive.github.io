He was shot at afternoon but he didn't leave the place. After the brutal attack he manged to take a place at Banasri mosque. Now he is safe. He came from Pabna only to take part in this program. How shame I am 26 years old but coward did my office all day, cried almost full night and could not sleep but did not go there.... feel like guilty..\n\u098f\u0995 \u09ab\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u09a8 \u098f\u09b0 \u09ae\u09c7\u09b8\u09c7\u099c"}
