Today, already about 200 people sacrificed their lives and injured unnumberable for the betterment of the nation. Their only fault is that they want restoration of their elected president Morsi who encourages them to follow the commandments of Allah and His beloved Prophet (pbuh)\n\nArmy officials are oftenly violating all the rules of Human Rights and shooting people like birds. We hate all those armies who created this bloody situation.\n\nI think that the only solution is to restoration of Muhammad Morsi, and proper judgement of these killings....\n-Delwar"}
