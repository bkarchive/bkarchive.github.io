The incident of killing of 7 Jamaat-Shibir leaders at home through a night-long raid by cops and BGB personnel is really unprecedented in the history of independent Bangladesh. Such brutal action of the government on the eve of the national Victory Day but proves their heinous mindset. Realizing its sure fall, the government engaged in killing innocent men like the then imperialistic Pakistani forces. The ongoing state-backed mass killing further connoted Awami League\u2019s fascist character.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe said, \u201cCops shot 3 men dead in joipurhat in the afternoon yesterday and of those killed, 2 were Shibir leaders, namely Shamim and Insan and 1 was a van driver named Firoj. The government is now ruling the country by using policemen and BGB personnel as its party thugs. But all these nasty attempts of the government are to fail and fall in a heap. Detained national heroes will be set free by ousting the government through effective student movement. All the culprits in this regard must face trial in this very land InShaAllah.\u201d\r\n\r\nShibir Secretary-General urged the government and police department to stop the ongoing mass killing in the country and apologize to the countrymen.","picture":"https:\/\/fbcdn-photos-a-a.akamaihd.net\/hphotos-ak-ash3\/1522099_592544850833483_507492272_s.jpg"}
