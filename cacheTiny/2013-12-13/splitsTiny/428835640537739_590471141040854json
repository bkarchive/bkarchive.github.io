However, others gathered at a major intersection in Dhaka to celebrate the execution, saying it delivered justice for crimes committed four decades ago.\r\n\r\nConcerned over the escalation of violence and the emergence of instability in the country, Turkey had undertaken diplomatic efforts to prevent the execution of the leader.\r\n\r\nErdo\u011fan urged his Bangladeshi counterpart to halt the execution on Thursday, hours after the Supreme Court had cleared the way for the execution of Mollah.\r\n\r\nHe expressed condolences for Mollah before a crowd of cheering supporters in Aegean province of \u0130zmir on Friday. He said there are nearly 300 cases similar to Mollah and spoke about the necessity to end this kind of cases.\r\n\r\n\u201cI want to particularly stress that this kind of emotional investigations should end and that everyone is expecting the realization of justice,\u201d Erdo\u011fan said.\r\n\r\nHe also called on the Bangladeshi people not to \u201cabandon the political fight.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause withdrawal means leaving the square [of the battle] to other powers and that one needs not to get tired of struggle for democracy,\u201d Erdo\u011fan added.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Ankara strongly condemned the execution Mollah despite international outcry against the move and said it is concerned that the execution will escalate the already high tension in the country.\r\n\r\nDavuto\u011flu also spoke with Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal, US Secretary of State John Kerry and British Foreign Secretary William Hague in an effort to prevent the execution of the opposition leader and to discuss ways to help maintain stability in Bangladesh.\r\n\r\nAnkara issued a statement strongly condemning the execution soon after it happened.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe execution of the death penalty sentence given to one of the leaders of Jamaat-e-Islami, Abdul Quader Mollah, despite all concerns and suggestions voiced by the international community, including our prime minister, has led to a grave sadness and indignation. We harshly condemn this execution; may God have mercy upon him,\u201d said the statement.\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozda\u011f offered Turkey's first reaction. He said: \u201cJustice, human rights and the law have been trampled. History will never remember well those who executed Mollah or had the chance to prevent his execution but did not, just as how Turkey does not remember well those who executed former Prime Minister Adnan Menderes, former Foreign Minister Fatin R\u00fc\u015ft\u00fc Zorlu and former Finance Minister Hasan Polatkan [who were executed following the May 27, 1960 military coup].\u201d\r\n\r\nRecalling a letter sent by Turkish President Abdullah G\u00fcl to Bangladeshi President Zillur Rahman, Ankara's statement said that Turkey made all diplomatic efforts at the international level to prevent the execution. Last year, G\u00fcl had sent a letter to Rahman asking for \u201cclemency\u201d for the five defendants charged with war crimes, including Mollah, at Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) for the \u201csake of peace in society.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTurkey believes that wounds of the past cannot be healed and social consensus cannot be reached this way. We are concerned that the execution of the penalty and continuation of actions with this mentality will lead to further escalation of the tension in Bangladesh,\u201d added Ankara's statement, saying that Turkey will continue to support the people of Bangladesh and wishes for a peaceful end to these critical times in their country.\r\n\r\nMollah's execution was the first ordered by the special tribunal formed by Prime Minister Hasina in 2010 to judge cases of people suspected of crimes committed during the war of independence.\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.todayszaman.com\/news-333932-erdogan-calls-execution-of-bangladeshi-opposition-leader-a-historic-mistake.html","picture":"https:\/\/fbcdn-photos-g-a.akamaihd.net\/hphotos-ak-frc3\/988408_590471124374189_887155308_s.jpg"}
