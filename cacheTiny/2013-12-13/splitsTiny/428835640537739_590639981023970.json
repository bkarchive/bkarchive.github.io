Let him rise on the Day of Judgment with that around his neck. So that His Lord will see him with that and the believers will see that too. What an excellent death, O Abdul Qadir! I'm sure you have found your Lord's promise true. I'm sure your tormentors will soon find their Lord's promise to them to be true too.\n\nAbuSamihah Sirajul-Islam"}
