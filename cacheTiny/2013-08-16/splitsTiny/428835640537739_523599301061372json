We may differ whether protesting was legitimate or not. However, no Muslim should doubt that approving bloodshed is wrong, no matter how much we differ with each other. No Muslim is allowed to justify this massacre, let alone be happy for it happening. Such carnage can only please the Zionists and their hypocrite allies in the region. Today is Friday! An hour before sunset, take some time off and go to the masjid and supplicate real hard that Allah would avenge the victims. Ask Allah to expose the hypocrites who supported this and aided it. This is most likely the hour that Allah answers our supplication on Friday. May Allah be with the people of Egypt and save us from similar fate and destruction.\n\n\u09b6\u09be\u09df\u0996 \u0986\u09b8\u09bf\u09ae \u0986\u09b2\u09b9\u09be\u0995\u09bf\u09ae"}
