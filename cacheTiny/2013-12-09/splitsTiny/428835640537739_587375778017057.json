However, the tribunal did state in its order that the defence request for 48 witnesses was 'given with the intention to delay the trial' and the court may have chosen the number 20 to equal the number of prosecution witnesses that had \u2018made statements regarding occurrence.\u2019\n\nIn some of the subsequent trials, particularly those that took place in Tribunal 2, the judges have given more detailed reasons.\n\nDecisions given in Molla\u2019s case\nAbdul Quader Molla\u2019s case was the second case to come to trial at the International Crimes Tribunal and the reasons given in that case for limiting the number of witnesses have set the precedent for most of the subsequent cases.\n\nIn the trial, the prosecution brought 12 witnesses to the tribunal in support of six charges against Molla.\n\nAfter all these witnesses had deposed, the prosecution lawyers filed an application asking the tribunal to limit the number of defence witnesses \u2018to 3 or 4\u2019 which it was argued would be sufficient for the accused to prove his defence of \u2018alibi\u2019 (i.e, the claim that the accused was not present at the time the offence was committed.)\n\nThe prosecution in its application to the tribunal argued that the list of 965 witnesses that the defence had earlier given the tribunal was simply intended \u2018to cause unreasonable delay so that the case can not be disposed of expeditiously.\u2019\n\nIn response, Molla\u2019s defence lawyers told the tribunal that although they had originally listed nearly 1000 witnesses, they wished now only to bring to court about 20.\n\nIn its order given on 5 November, the tribunal initially limited the defence to four witnesses, but - following further urging by the defence lawyers \u2013 the number was increased to five and then to six.\n\nA week later this order was challenged by Molla\u2019s lawyers, but without success.\n\nThe tribunal\u2019s basic argument for the restriction, set out in its original order and in response to the review application, was that the accused only needed witnesses to present his defence of alibi, and that for this purpose six witnesses was sufficient.\n\n\u201cFrom the trend of cross-examination of prosecution witnesses no specific and substantive defence case could be perceived excepting the plea of alibi,\u201d the first order stated.\n\nThe order went on to argue that the defence did not need to produce witnesses to question any other aspect of the prosecution case since the burden of proving the charges was wholly on the prosecution.\n\n \u201cThe claim that the accused was not involved with the commission of offences for which he has been charged is a negative assertion which is not required to be established by adducing evidence,\u2019 the order stated. \u2018Besides, the defence is to prove nothing. Adjudication of facts in issue does not depend upon the success or failure in proving defence. In a criminal trial, 'defence case' is simply of \u2018innocence'\u201d\n\nThe second order supported thisargument: \u2018In a criminal trial, defence may examine witnesses in support of his defence and not to disprove prosecution case\u2026 [W]e are constrained to reiterate that the defence is to prove nothing and the burden squarely lies upon the prosecution to prove the charges beyond reasonable doubt.\u2019\n\nHowever, these arguments are problematic on a number of counts.\n\nFirst, one has to ask whether it is the job of the tribunal to decide what is - or what will or should be - the nature of the defence\u2019s legal strategy?\n\nThis is for the defence to decide, not the tribunal.\n\nDo note that this decision was made before the accused has even started presenting his case, and without the tribunal having seen any information on the likely testimony of the proposed defence witnesses.\n\nSecondly, even if the tribunal happened to be correct that Molla\u2019s lawyers only wanted to bring Alibi witnesses (in fact at least one of the witnesses Molla called was not an alibi witness) how could the tribunal, before it had heard any defence witnesses, be in a position to state that six witnesses would be sufficient?\n\nIt was of course reasonable for the tribunal to say that 955 alibi witnesses was way over the top.\n\nBut if Molla needed 2 or 3 witnesses to \u2018prove\u2019 his alibi for each of the six different offences which took place on six different dates \u2013 each of which, one should remember, had the potential of a death sentence - it is difficult to see why the tribunal would not be willing to allow that.\n\nThirdly, and most significantly, the tribunal surely cannot be right to assert that the defence can only bring witnesses to prove an alibi defence \u2013 and not to prove in other ways that the prosecution case was wrong.\n\nThe tribunal\u2019s logic seems to be that since it is for the prosecution to prove the charges, the accused lawyers have no role in disproving them by bringing witnesses.\n\nThis is rather extraordinary.\n\nYes, the burden is on the prosecution to prove its case \u2018beyond reasonable doubt\u2019, but this in no way means \u2013 and Bangladesh law has never stated otherwise - that the defence cannot bring witnesses to discredit different elements of the prosecution case, and show, for example, the unreliability of prosecution witnesses.\n\nDoing so is a completely standard defence practice in just about any country around the world \u2013 including in Bangladesh.\n\nThe need for the prosecution to prove its case \u2018beyond reasonable doubt\u2019 cannot be turned into a rule that prevents the accused from disproving the case against him or her.\n\nHow to explain the tribunal\u2019s reasoning\nSince there is no prior jurisprudence in Bangladesh supporting such a contention, what then might be the basis for the tribunal\u2019s argument?\n\nIn ordinary criminal cases in Bangladesh, defence counsel \u2013 though they have every legal right to do so - rarely produce witnesses in support of the accused.\n\nThis is for many reasons, but primarily the decision by the defence not to call witnesses, is because it is their view that the prosecution\u2019s legal case against the accused is so weak that they can succeed in obtaining acquittals simply by discrediting prosecution witnesses in their cross examinations.\n\nAs a result, there is no reason for the accused to subsequently produce any witnesses in support of its case.\n\nArguably, the tribunal judges may in their minds have converted this practice in the country\u2019s criminal courts into some kind of legal principle.\n\nUnder the International Crimes Tribunal Act 1973, the tribunal can set its own procedures \u2013 but legal arguments justifying something so essential as the limitation of witnesses do need to have some prior jurisprudential support.\n\nAnd whilst the Act does state that the tribunal should \u2018confine the trial to an expeditious hearing\u2019 it also requires the tribunal to \u2018ensure fair trial\u2019 and specifically provides that the accused be given \u2018the right to present evidence at the trial in support of his defence ...\u2019.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision preventing defence lawyers from calling witnesses who could discredit the prosecution case does raise very legitimate questions about how Molla \u2013 and indeed all the other accused - received a fair trial.\n\nClearly, it was unjustified for the defence lawyers to provide the tribunal with a lists of witnesses  with hundreds and sometimes thousands of names in Molla\u2019s and other cases \u2013 and the tribunal quite rightly rejected the idea that anywhere near that number of witnesses could be brought to court by the defence.\n\nBut conversely it is questionable for the tribunal to have restricted the number of witnesses to six in Molla\u2019s case and even fewer in others \u2013 particularly without having any information on the relevance of the witnesses on substantive issues before the court.\n\nThe appellate division has upheld Molla\u2019s convictions, and so one assumes that the highest court in Bangladesh did not feel that the restriction on the number of defence witnesses precluded a fair trial. \n\nIt will be interesting \u2013 when the full judgment of the appellate division in Molla\u2019s case is published, (which could well be soon) - to see how the court justifies the restriction in defence witnesses.\n\nAnd also to see what view the appellate division will take when it subsequently deals with other cases where the restrictions on the number of defence witnesses were even more stark \u2013 particularly when contrasted with both the number of offences for which the person was accused and the number of witnesses the prosecution were allowed to bring.\n\nhttp:\/\/bangladeshwarcrimes.blogspot.com\/2013\/11\/are-tribunals-justified-in-restricting.html"}
