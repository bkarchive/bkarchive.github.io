I can only understand what his family is going through, but I am not worried about him. As far as I know, he is a man of courage and he is ready to sacrifice his life for the cause of Allah. However, as a Muslim, we should never give up hope and should always seek Allah's blessings. Only a miracle can save his life, but it is Allah who reserves the right of doing miracles. let us all pray that Allah saves His dedicated servant from such injustice. As a victim ourselves, I know how desperate his family might feel at this moment. I don't know if I can ever see my beloved father in future, but at least for the moment, I know that he is there. May Allah give patience to this family and all the oppressed brothers and sisters in Bangladesh and save us from the evil Hasina government that has turned our beautiful land into a living hell!\n\n- \u200d\u09b8\u09be\u09b2\u09ae\u09be\u09a8 \u0986\u09b2 \u0986\u09af\u09ae\u09c0"}
