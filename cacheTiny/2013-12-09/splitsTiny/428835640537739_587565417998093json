We call on the Prime\nMinister to refrain from interfering directly to speed up the execution, which she is\nabusing for entirely political purposes.\n\u2018The Bangladesh Jail Code allows a 21 day review. No execution can be carried out within\n21 days of the receipt of certified judgment. This decision to execute Mollah willfully\ndisregards this fundamental right of review.\n\u2018At the same time we call on the British Government and the European Union \u2013 both of\nwhich have policies to campaign against the death sentence wherever it is used \u2013 to put\nmaximum pressure on the Government of Bangladesh, including immediate visa\nrestrictions for the Prime Minister and Government Ministers involved in this decision\u2019.\nAbdul Quader Mollah has been sentenced by the International Crimes Tribunal \u2013 a local court \u2013\nunder circumstances that have included the abduction of opposition witnesses, the use of forced\nand fake testimony, co-ordination of sentences before trials that have been completed by the\nGovernment, the refusal of international monitoring and of international defence counsel\nrepresentatives to enter the country.\nOrganisations including Human Rights Watch, the International Commission of Jurists and\nrespected international media organizations such as The Economist have all condemned these\npractices and the legitimacy of the Tribunal. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi\nPillay has separately condemned the Tribunal saying it does not meet the standards expected for\nthe delivery of fair justice.\nLord Carlile commented:\n\u2018This is an incendiary act aimed at dividing Bangladesh and enflaming the opposition,\nwhich has already been forced onto the streets in protest against Government policies.\n\u2018The only way Sheikh Hasina can delay an election is to force a state of emergency, and it\nseems she is trying to provoke the opposition, and with it the death of many more\nopposition supporters on the streets of Bangladesh to achieve it. It is clear the\ngovernment of Bangladesh is willing to use these cynical and irresponsible tactics to\nderail the democratic process. It is a shameful piece of politicking which will result in\nuntold misery for Bangladeshis in the coming months.\u2019\nSir Geoffrey Nice QC, former prosecutor of Slobodan Milosevic, commented: \u2018This trial has not\nadhered to even the most basic international standards. It is concerning that this\nexecution is taking place after such a deeply flawed judicial process. That the justified\nconcerns of international legal experts are being so willfully ignored suggests these trials\nhave lost all legitimacy.\u2019\nKirstey Brimelow QC, Chair of the Bar Human Rights Committee added: \u2018There is now a clear\nconsensus amongst the international legal community that this tribunal is not credible. It\nis a real concern that there has not been enough pressure from Bangladesh\u2019s international\npartners to halt these executions, especially from those nations who have been\ncampaigning vociferously for the abolition of the death penalty.\u2019\nOther war crimes experts who have also expressed their concer today include Karim Khan QC,\nformer legal adviser to UN International Criminal Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia and International\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda.\nENDS\n\nCONTACT:\nHouse of Lords, London, SW1A 0PW Tel: 0207 219 5353 carlilea@parliament.uk"}
