While the three men fall on each other, the woman lands on her face and the husband on his back. The barely six months old child of the couple came of worst. The child, seen under the front wheel of the bike, was rushed to hospital with severe injuries. \r\n\r\nPhoto: Anisur Rahman, The Daily Star","picture":"http:\/\/photos-d.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-frc3\/1170921_521263864628249_308342853_s.jpg"}
