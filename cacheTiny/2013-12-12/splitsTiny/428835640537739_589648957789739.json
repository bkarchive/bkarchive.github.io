His Islamist party, Jamaat-e-Islami, an ally of the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, has warned of \"dire consequences\" if he is executed.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, Erdo\u011fan called Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and asked him to halt the execution of the opposition leader.\r\n\r\nMollah, 65, was convicted of war crimes committed during the nation's war of independence against Pakistan in 1971. His lawyers tried to convince the Supreme Court, which began hearing the case Wednesday, to throw out the sentence.\r\n\r\nMollah would be the first person executed in special trials begun by Hasina in 2010 of people suspected of crimes during the war of independence. The government says Pakistani soldiers, aided by local collaborators, killed 3 million people and raped 200,000 women during the nine-month war.\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.todayszaman.com\/news-333805-erdogan-urges-bangladeshi-pm-to-halt-execution-of-opposition-leader.html","picture":"http:\/\/photos-d.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-prn1\/996097_589648937789741_356708872_s.jpg"}
