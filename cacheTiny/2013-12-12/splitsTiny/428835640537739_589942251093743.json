Is this now the principle of law in Bangladesh.\n\nThe tribunal\u2019s logic is that since it is for the prosecution to prove the charges, the accused lawyers have no role in disproving them - by doing such annoying things like bringing witnesses.\n\nThis is rather extraordinary. Yes, the burden is on the prosecution to prove its case \u2018beyond reasonable doubt\u2019, but this in no way means \u2013 and Bangladesh law has never stated otherwise - that the defence cannot bring witnesses to discredit different elements of the prosecution case, and show, for example, the unreliability of prosecution witnesses.\n\nDoing so is a completely standard defence practice in just about any country around the world \u2013 including in Bangladesh.\n\n- David Bergman"}
