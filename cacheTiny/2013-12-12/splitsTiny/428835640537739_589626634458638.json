Yes, I think there are many legal inadequacies in the International Crimes (Tribunal) Act 1973, but that is also not the reason? Yes, I am aware of the many controversies and scandals that have taken place at the tribunal (including the abduction of a defence witness, the release of skype conversations\/e-mails showing at least one of the tribunal judges in collusion with the prosecution and the government, and at least 6 tribunal investigators and prosecutors seeking last month Awami League parliamentary seats) - but again these controversies, and there are many more, are not in themselves sufficient to make me object to Molla's death penalty. The reason why I think it is outrageous to put Molla to death is because of the flimsiness of the evidence on the charge for which he has been sentenced to death and the fact that the tribunal simply did not allow him to put forward his defence, restricting his witnesses to five.\" \n\n David Bergman"}
