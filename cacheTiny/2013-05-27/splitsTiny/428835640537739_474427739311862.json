There are some elements within her party that have been bought by Awamileague and play an informant role. Others are leftist who don\u2019t like her association with the Islamist and then there are those who are hateful towards Jamati Islam. Another of her problem is that she is encircled by aging leaders that are too cautious and not so bold to take the fight to the government. Begum Zias\u2019 own health problem is an impediment to her ability to be active and mobile and too often she is unable meet her party activists or visit them in order to give them moral boast.\n\n- Mozafor Ali (Columnist and Political Analysts)"}
