The availability of individual choice is fundamental to a vibrant democracy.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore extremely disappointing that more than half of the country\u2019s parliamentary seats were not contested freely, but instead were filled through acclamation.\n\n\u201cCanada notes with dismay the violence and controversy that marred the electoral period. Hundreds of Bangladeshi citizens were killed in political violence in 2013. We condemn this violence in the strongest terms, particularly the senseless attacks on the most vulnerable citizens\u2014children, women, and religious and ethnic minorities. Violence as a political strategy is unacceptable. Canada calls on all parties to publicly renounce and condemn political violence.\n\n\u201cPolitical instability has bred economic instability, which has caused long-term damage to Bangladesh\u2019s economy and may continue to do so. We fear that this damage has undermined Bangladesh\u2019s economic progress and developmental path.\n\n\u201cCanada calls on all parties to look beyond their immediate political concerns and work cooperatively to focus nationally on Bangladesh\u2019s development and its bright future.\n\n\u201cCanada welcomes the major parties\u2019 willingness to consider holding a new national election and urges all parties to reach an agreement soon that would allow the next election to be truly participatory, with results that all Bangladeshis will see as credible.\u201d\n\n- 30 -\n\nFor further information, media representatives may contact:\n\nMedia Relations Office \nForeign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada\n613-995-1874\nmedia@international.gc.ca\nFollow us on Twitter: @DFATDCanada\n\nDate Modified:2014-01-06"}
