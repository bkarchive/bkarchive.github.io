Whoever has done it should be brought to justice and exemplary punishment should be awarded to the perpetrators.\nAt the same time government should take immediate steps to protect them from any future threat. I propose following steps should be taken very soon:\n1. Set CCTV camera at all mondeers, pagoda etc.\n2. Establish special camp at identified places.\n3. Constitute an independent judicial inquiry committee to look into the matter.\n4. Organise their rehabilitation as soon as possible.\n5. All destructed establishments should be reconstituted soon.\n6.Government should call a combind meeting of the religious leaders of all community of that locality and ensure religious harmony with their participation.\n7. All Imam of that locality can visit those places and offer special prayer for the recovery.\n8. Islamic leaders should come forward and announce islamic sanction on such type of attack as they did against Bangla Bhai.\n9. Government or media before finally blaming any individual or group of individuals should identify perpetrators including their personal detail.\n10. Alleged political parties should also conduct an independent inquiry and if found any members connected with the incident he or she should be expelled from the party."}
