In addition, the ongoing people\u2019s revolt has upset its stance. This is why it is going on with its ever-known conspiracies to slide the sham election and people\u2019s upsurge to an opposite direction. It is attacking houses of the minority people by strewing its party thugs and trying to shift the liability on the opposition men, especially Jamaat-Shibir activists. But the countrymen are not that stupid. The patriotic student segment will not quit their movement until people\u2019s demand is served and the farcical election is canceled.\u201d","picture":"http:\/\/photos-b.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-ash3\/t1\/1532018_607559905998644_901723312_s.jpg"}
