The 65-year-old had been convicted earlier this year of crimes against humanity during Bangladesh\u2019s brutal war of independence in 1971.\n\n\u201cNever before in the history of Bangladesh, when a trial court refused to give the death sentence [has] the final court [then] given the death sentence,\u201d Mullah\u2019s main lawyer, Abdur Razzaq, told The Independent.\n\nMullah, a senior leader of the Jamaat-e-Islami party, had been found guilty in February. At the time, when the court sentenced him to life imprisonment, there were massive protests in Dhaka and other cities from secular groups and ordinary people, demanding that he receive the death penalty.\n\nThe demonstrations, and subsequent counter protests from Islamic groups, left up to 100 people dead.\n\nThe scale of the \u201cShahbagh protests\u201d, when scores of thousands of people poured onto the streets, unnerved the government of prime minister Sheikh Hasina and led it amend the law to allow prosecutors to appeal against sentences handed down by the courts. Until that point, prosecutors could only appeal if a court acquitted a defendant.\n\nMullah, who had been dubbed the Butcher of Mirpur, was accused of the murder of hundreds of civilians in a suburb of Dhaka during the war of independence, which saw widescale atrocities.\n\nAhead of Tuesday\u2019s decision, announced by a five-member panel headed by chief justice M Muzammel Hossain, lawyers for Mullah, claimed the legal process taking place in Bangladesh to deal with the incidents of 1971, had fallen foul of political influence. They said the trial had also relied on hearsay evidence. Mullah had denied the charges against him.\n\n\u201cThe trial process has been shown to be nothing short of a political show trial aimed at removing an Islamist political party, suppressing the opposition and securing the next election for the present Awami League government,\u201d said Toby Cadman, one of Mullah\u2019s international lawyers.\n\nAnywhere up to three million people were killed in Bangladesh\u2019s struggle for independence, which was triggered when Pakistan\u2019s military refused to accept the results of democratic elections at the end of 1970 which were won by the Awami League, headed by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, father of the current premier.\n\nThe court which is hearing the war crimes cases was set up in 2010 by the current government to deal with those people accused of collaborating with Pakistani forces. Mullah\u2019s party had opposed an independent Bangladesh.\n\nBangladesh\u2019s attorney-general, Mahbube Alam, on Tuesday claimed that there was no option to challenge the ruling but Mullah\u2019s lawyer, Mr Razzaq, said he would file a petition. Mullah can also seek clemency from the president.\n\nActivists who had demonstrated for the death sentence in February, welcomed Tuesday\u2019s decision. Imran Sarkar, a spokesman for the so-called Ganajagaran Mancha, made up of the activists and citizens who had protested in Dhaka\u2019s Shahbagh neighbourhood, told Bdnews24.com: \u201cThe verdict has dispelled all our doubts on whether we would get justice.\u201d\n\nBut the verdict outraged Mullah\u2019s supporters, some of whom clashed with police in several towns, including Chittagong. Reuters said that five five police were wounded in the port city when activists set fire to a police car and exploded bombs.\n\nJamaat has also called for a 48-hour nationwide shutdown as of Wednesday morning and the authorities have said they are increasing security in anticipation.\n\nEarlier this year, when another Jamaat leader, Delwar Hossain Sayedee, was given the death sentence, a shutdown claimed the lives of more than 39 people.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/world\/asia\/security-forces-braced-for-unrest-as-bangladeshi-islamist-leader-abdul-kader-mullah-sentenced-to-death-8821136.html"}
