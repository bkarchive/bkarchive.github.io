In response, parliament amended a law to allow the state to appeal against any verdict or sentence passed by the tribunal.\n\nBangladesh has been hit in recent months by a wave of violent protests over war crimes convictions, presenting the government with a security and credibility challenge in the run-up to elections early next year.\n\nMore than 100 people have been killed in protests and counter-protests since January.\n\nMollah's lawyer Abdur Razzak dismissed Tuesday's sentence as politically motivated and said the defence would file a petition for a review, but the attorney general, Mahbube Alam, said a review was not an option under the constitution.\n\n\"This decision over which the accused now has no further right of appeal or review is in clear breach of international law,\" Mollah's international legal team said in a statement.\n\n\"It lends further weight to calls for the war crimes trials to be condemned and replaced by a credible, international criminal tribunal under the auspices of the United Nations.\"\n\nSeveral Jamaat leaders and two from the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist party (BNP) are still on trial at the tribunal. The New York-based Human Rights Watch group has said the tribunal's procedures fall short of international standards.\n\nJamaat activists skirmished with police in several towns, including the port of Chittagong, after the death sentence was announced. Five police were wounded in Chittagong when activists set fire to a police car and exploded crude bombs.\n\nThe war trials have angered Islamists and the BNP, who call them a politically motivated bid to persecute the leadership of Jamaat. The government has denied the charges.\n\nParamilitary troops have been deployed in Bogra, where previous war crimes verdicts sparked violent protests by Islamists, police said. The city is a political stronghold of the BNP leader, Begum Khaleda Zia, an arch-rival of the prime minister, Sheikh Hasina.\n\nJamaat called for a 48-hour countrywide strike from Wednesday.\n\nIn July, a court declared Jamaat-e-Islami illegal, effectively banning it from the election. Six party leaders have been convicted of various crimes in connection with the war.\n\nMollah's party opposed Bangladeshi independence from Pakistan in the 1971 war but it denies accusations that its leaders committed murder, rape and torture.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2013\/sep\/17\/bangladesh-islamic-leader-death-sentence"}
