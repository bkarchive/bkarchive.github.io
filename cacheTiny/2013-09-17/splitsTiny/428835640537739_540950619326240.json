The conclusions regarding charge 6 (Hazrat Ali Killing):\n\n1. Only one witness Momena begum deposed before the #Tribunal. It is extremely unsafe to award death sentence on the basis of single witness. Hono'ble Appellate Division has committed error of law and hence the sentence is liable to be set aside.\n\n2. Momena Begum's gave statement to the Muktijoddha Jadughor, Mirpur (Jalladkhana) and descried same incidence to them but she didn't implicate Quader Molla and hence her statement given before the Tribunal is false and fabricated. We submitted her early recorded statement before the Appellate Division but the Hon'ble AD has failed to consider those documents and committed serious error of law and hence the conviction is liable to be set aside. \n\n3. Before coming to the court her statement was recorded by the investigation officer but in that statement she also didn't implicate Quader Molla with the offense and hence the AD has failed to appreciate the contradiction between her statement made before the tribunal and the statement recorded by the IO. \n\n4. it is for the first time Momena Begum, the daughter of Hazrat Ali, implicated AQM with the crime after coming to the Tribunal. It is validly inferred that she has been seriously tutored by the prosecution and hence she is unbelievable and unreliable.\n\n5. It was also recorded in her earlier statement that she went to her husband's residence two days before the incidence. Therefore it was impossible for her to see the incidence and hence her statement is completely unreliable. \n\n6. In this circumstances, We are of the view that the sentence awarded by the AD is liable to be set aside.","picture":"http:\/\/photos-d.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-ash3\/558881_540950605992908_1862180625_s.jpg"}
