Instead of \u2018Politics of Change\u2019 it reinforced \u2018old politics\u2019 with arrogance, whims and vengeance.\u201d\r\nMahfuz Anam said: \u201cNothing exemplifies these three traits more than the arrogant manner in which the Padma Bridge loan was cancelled, the whimsical way in which the caretaker government system was abolished and the vengeful manner in which Prof Yunus has been treated for the last four and half years and the way Grameen Bank(GB) is being proposed to be dismantled.\u201d\r\nHe said: \u201cAs we have repeatedly written, only one man stood between the World Bank (WB) loan and the Padma bridge. At the end, it was supreme arrogance that made Sheikh Hasina side with that \u2018one man\u2019 ( in spite of pleading by most of her cabinet colleagues and senior leaders) in total disregard of a \u201cpublic good\u201d that would have directly benefited millions of people, given additional GDP growth and impacted positively on the overall economy. Arrogance overtook everything, including and ironically, self interest.\u201d\r\nIn a front-page commentary, the Daily Star editor said, the chest-thumping and crowd churning talk of \u201cself-financing\u201d is a cheap play on national pride and can be termed as the biggest defrauding of public sentiment after the Share Market and Hall Mark scams.\r\n\u201cAs our finance minister very well knows, the only \u2018real\u2019 measure of public wealth is \u201copportunity cost\u201d. Of course, Bangladesh with nearly $40bn annual income from just garments and remittance can \u201cself- finance\u201d not one but several Padma Bridges. But should it, given the need for resources in many crucial fields like rural infrastructure, roads, railways, waterways, telecommunication, energy, industrialisation? These are but just a few areas where an absence of crucial funding is holding growth back.\u201d\r\n\u201cOnly the proverbial ostrich with its head in the sand can say that we did not need those billions of dollars of nearly zero-interest money, \u201c Mahfuz Anam said.\r\nAs for national pride, far more insult, humiliation and bad name for the country resulted from the loan fiasco than can ever be gained from \u201cself-financing\u201d, which is a bad financial decision to say the least. Some day this government will be held accountable for such neglect and downright \u201cdishonouring\u201d of the public interest.\r\nMahfuz Anam also wrote about the way the non-party, neutral caretaker government was abolished by Hasina.\r\n\u201cIt took our PM two weeks to order her parliamentary party to abolish the caretaker system. Such a fundamental constitutional amendment passed with no questions asked? Something that was literally pushed down the throat of the people with nearly three years of street agitation and debilitating general strikes from 1994 to 1996, was changed by the \u2018whim\u2019 of the leader. There was no debate, no discussion and no questions asked. The \u2018sovereign\u2019 had asked and the pliant House delivered.\u201d\r\nHe went on: \u201cThe foolish opposition by its stubborn, unthinking, nonsensical and self-defeating boycott made the task that much more easier.\r\n\u201cNothing illustrates better the vengeful nature of the PM and the government she leads than the way Prof Yunus has been treated for the last four and a half years and by the plans being floated to dismantle Grameen Bank (GB). Ironically, both the present Finance Minister and the Governor of Bangladesh Bank, who must play pivotal roles in this process, know GB well.\r\nDeep within their hearts they must know that what they are doing is unjustified, unjust and downright wrong. Yet they are part of the destruction of the most famous body created by this \u201cmuch maligned\u201d country, an institution that was given the highest honour the present world can possibly give \u2014the Nobel Prize.\r\n\u201cIt is public knowledge that the finance minister is angry with Prof. Yunus. But anger cannot be the basis of action against an institution that brought unmatched glory and honour for our people at the global level. As for the Governor, that just an extension of service can muffle his conscience is very hard to believe. Both are honourable men. But their failure to raise their voices at such a crucial moment reserves history\u2019s judgement on them which, in my view, will be harsh\u201d, the Daily Star editor said.\r\nhttp:\/\/bdinn.com\/news\/daily-star-decries-misrule-by-hasina\/","picture":"https:\/\/fbcdn-photos-a-a.akamaihd.net\/hphotos-ak-prn1\/1016118_494192970668672_1555638200_s.jpg"}
