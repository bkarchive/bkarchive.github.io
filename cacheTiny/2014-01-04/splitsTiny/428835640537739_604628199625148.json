Cops attacked on peaceful processions in many places of the country. About 25 Shibir men got injured due to police-y attacks and 38 more have been nabbed unjustly by the policemen.\r\n\r\nShibir leaders said while carrying out today\u2019s shutdown, \u201cBangladesh fell into very deep crisis due to illegal power-greed of Awami League. Awami League tarnished the image of the country to the world by using the state-oriented institutions as well as departments for the sake of its party purpose. Bangladesh has been listed among top ten most vulnerable territories of the world. The Awami government has detached the country from the rest of the world by designing a one-sided and one-party election. But, the patriotic student segment won\u2019t allow such devastating conspiracy to be successful. The government\u2019s daydream about holding on power through a farcical election won\u2019t come true.\u201d","picture":"http:\/\/photos-d.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-frc1\/1468502_604627939625174_340025903_s.jpg"}
