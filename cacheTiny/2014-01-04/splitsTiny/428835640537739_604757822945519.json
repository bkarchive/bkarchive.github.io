They write about a set of proceedings which they might imagine, or indeed hope, is taking place. They are ideological pieces, rather than opinion based on fact. For all the good intentions and high principle of holding trials relating to 1971 (which I support), Bangladesh should not be proud of the judicial processes that resulted in Molla's execution.","picture":"http:\/\/photos-h.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-prn1\/1512684_604757509612217_1681269287_s.jpg"}
