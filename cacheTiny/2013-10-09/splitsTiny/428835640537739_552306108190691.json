Delawar Hussen and top leaders of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami before the upcoming Eid-ul-Azha.\r\n\r\nIn a statement, the Secretary-General of Bangladesh Islami Chhatrashibir Abdul Zabbar announced this agenda. Shibir Secretary-General said in the statement:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Awami oppressive government unjustly arrested Shibir Central President Md. Delawar Hussen on last 31st March and persecuted him severely putting him on remand under some falsified charges. On the other hand, the government is plotting to kill globally acclaimed Islamist political leaders like Professor Golam Azam, Maolana Motiur Rahman Nizami, Allama Delawar Hussain Saydee, Quader Molla etc by a sham trial under a farcical tribunal. We\u2019d like to call countrywide demos for tomorrow demanding unconditional release of all arrested Jamaat-Shibir leaders including Shibir Central President Md. Delawar Hussen and abolishment of the farcical tribunal before the upcoming Eid event.\u201d","picture":"http:\/\/photos-a.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-prn2\/1378752_552306101524025_1208141766_s.jpg"}
