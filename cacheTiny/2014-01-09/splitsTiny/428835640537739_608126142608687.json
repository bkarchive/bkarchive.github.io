Cops attacked and shot at the Shibir men while carrying out blockade and left 7 injured. 4 more have been unjustly nabbed.\r\n\r\nShibir leaders said during the blockade program, \u201cAwami League started to revenge the countrymen as they didn\u2019t cast their votes for it. As a part of this revenge, it is making inhuman attacks on people\u2019s lives, vandalizing as well as looting their houses by its party thugs and joint task forces strewed. It is also going on arresting prominent lawyers and national leaders. Even it is not hesitating in the least to inhumanely arrest the civilians from the Janaja prayer (an Islamic tradition of saying prayer for a deceased). On the other hand, it is attacking houses of the minority community to hide its heinous acts fatal to democracy and attempting to shift the liability on the Opposition. But the people better know that all these acts are some pre-planned dramas staged with an aim to hide the electoral farce and its aftermath. These acts will hold no water. The student segment is out to counter all sorts of oppression and foil all types of conspiracies of the government. So, despite all conspiracies of oppression, the nasty Awami won\u2019t be spared at all.\u201d","picture":"http:\/\/photos-a.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-prn1\/t1\/1524783_608125652608736_1621187813_s.jpg"}
