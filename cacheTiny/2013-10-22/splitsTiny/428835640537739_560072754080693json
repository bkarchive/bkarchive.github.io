Cops are arresting Shibir men on everyday basis in different districts of the country including the capital city. False cases are being logged against the arrestees with an aim to deactivate the ongoing students\u2019 upsurge and movement against the government. The police-y persecution nationwide heralds government\u2019s unwillingness for any dialogue and sincere desire for clashes. They long to hold on power by creating pre-planned unrest across the country.\u201d\r\n\r\nShibir Secretary-General said, \u201cOver half a hundred Shibir men were arrested even yesterday. This massive arrest enterprise of the government is a red signal for the sustainability of democracy itself. We\u2019d like to urge the government to immediately release all the arrested leaders and activists of Chhatrashibir and mend its immoral attitude towards its political opponents.\u201d\r\n\r\nShibir Secretary-General urged the law enforcement agency personnel to shun their undemocratic actions and stop harassing the people by filing false and fabricated cases.","picture":"https:\/\/fbcdn-photos-b-a.akamaihd.net\/hphotos-ak-prn2\/1374188_560072737414028_1541208134_s.jpg"}
