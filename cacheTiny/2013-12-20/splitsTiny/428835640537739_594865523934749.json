It has to become public knowledge:\r\n\r\nThe Indian govt made a proposal to Khaleda Zia yesterday. A delegation of journalists met BNP and Khaleda Zia yesterday. They included the following people:\r\n1. Mr. Shubhajit Roy (Indian Express)\r\n2. Mr. Jayanth Jacob (Hindustan Times)\r\n3. Ms. Indrani Dutta (The Hindu)\r\n4. Mr. Gautam Lahiri (Sangbad Pratidin)\r\n5. Ms. Devirupa Mitra (New Indian Express)\r\n6. Mr. Royden D'Souza (Doordarshan)\r\n7. Mr. Dipanjan Roy Chaudhury (Economic Times)\r\n8. Mr. Agni Roy (Anand Bazar Patrika)\r\n\r\nThis delegation was a cover for two additional persons who met and spoke to Khaleda Zia. These two persons were the deputy chief of RAW and a Deputy Secretary of the govt of India. \r\n\r\nTheir proposal to BNP was as follows:\r\n1. accept the 10th parliament\r\n2. India will ensure election to 11th parliament in 6 months\r\n3. India would patronise BNP in those elections\r\n4. Current jamaat leaders will be executed and new leadership of Jamaat will be under patronage of India\r\n5. India will fulfil all bilateral commitments made to present govt\r\n\r\nKhaleda Zia did not agree to the proposal. \r\n\r\nThe same team met with Gen Ershad at CMH. But they gave a different proposal to him:\r\n\r\n1. In next elections held within six months, both ladies would be out and Ershad as India's candidate will become PM.\r\n2. Jamaat would be uprooted by then.\r\n3. BNP'S backbone would be broken by then and most BNP people would join Ershad.\r\n4. Ershad should just leave the country and quietly accept election to 10th election.","picture":"http:\/\/photos-f.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-ash3\/541755_594865507268084_1376271672_s.jpg"}
