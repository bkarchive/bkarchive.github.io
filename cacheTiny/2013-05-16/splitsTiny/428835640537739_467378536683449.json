I asked the value of wheel chair during Savar tragedy. At Shyamoli, a retailer asked for about 2500 tk for each wheel chair. If they budget 3000tk for each, it is possible to buy 80 wheel chairs at least with 2,40,000 tk. Either CRP is making fun with this donations or they r buying super wheel chairs for the victims . I posted a comment on this article. But they removed it and also banned my email ID..
