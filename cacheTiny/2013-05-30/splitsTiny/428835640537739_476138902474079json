Most were Muslim, but some were also Buddhist owned.\r\nThe neighborhood was burned by Buddhist mobs following a quarrel between a Muslim gold shop owner and a Buddhist woman on March 20. Buddhists allege that later that day Muslims dragged a monk off a motorbike and tried to light him on fire in front of a mosque. Muslims claim the monk caught on fire when he was torching the mosque. More than 40 people were killed from the violence that resulted in hundreds of homes being destroyed over a course of a week- mainly Muslim - across 11 townships in Mandalay Division and Pegu Division.\r\nThe attacks on Muslim neighborhoods by Buddhist have coincided with the emergence of the 969 movement. The movement encourages Buddhists to shop at Buddhist owned shops with stickers to identify them. The most vocal advocate of the 969 movement is the Buddhist monk Ashin Wirathu. Wirathu s sermons border on paranoia, purporting that Muslim men are trying to convert the country to Islam by marrying Buddhist women. Wirathu was in Meikhtila when the violence erupted and was also there one month earlier to deliver a 3 day sermon.","picture":"https:\/\/fbcdn-photos-a-a.akamaihd.net\/hphotos-ak-prn1\/935999_476138875807415_1522377650_s.jpg"}
