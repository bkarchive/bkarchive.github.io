For this very reason, perhaps, not many newspapers write anniversary stories on the cruelty and crude brutality of that day. There is another more obvious reason why many people especially the pro-Indian so-called secular intellectuals in Bangladesh and abroad will remain oblivious to that tragic day: the people who were murdered on the streets of Dhaka on that day were \u2018Islamic\u2019 belonging to a religious group. Nowadays, such murders do not seem to draw much pity or make big headlines. Some credit goes to two former \u201cleaders\u201d \u2013 George Bush and Tony Blair \u2013 who began the twenty-first century with unlawful killings of humans (Muslims) in their hundreds and thousands. These days killing the Muslims globally and the people belonging to Islamic parties in Muslim lands locally are taken-for-granted matters. Even in non-Muslim countries with a better law and order situation, killing a Muslim does not seem to stir much public furor. In 2009, in the city of Dresden in Germany a Muslim woman of Egyptian descent was first teased, harassed and then killed in broad daylight in courtroom. The Western media including the secular ones in Muslim countries did not give adequate focus on that unlawful killing, as, apparently, the blood of the Muslims is considered cheaper than that of their fellow human beings.\n\nOn the eve of the handover of power from the BNP-Jamaat ruling alliance to the caretaker government, like other political parties, Jamaat organized a big rally in Dhaka to celebrate peacefully the successful power handover. Jamaat\u2019s rally was at the north gate of Baitul Mukarram masjid while Awami League gathered at Paltan. The latter wanted to defy the outgoing BNP-Jamaat alliance and demonstrate its brawn power. Many newspapers used words like \u201cclashes between the activists of the outgoing ruling alliance and the opposition.\u201d But actually what happened should not be described in such simple terms.\n\nAwami League chairperson who is the Prime Minister of Bangladesh now had told her party men to bring \u2018logi-boitha\u2019 (pole-oar) to their rally on that day. Her party men brought \u2013 together with logi-boitha \u2013 fire arms, knives and other lethal weapons for purposes the people of Bangladesh did not understand until they actually saw Sheikh Hasina\u2019s men in action. Without any provocation whatsoever, her party men first attacked Jamaat-Shibir people who were caught on their way to the Jamaat rally. The whole world saw how the professional Awami hooligans beat up to death about ten Jamaat-Shibir people on the streets of Dhaka in broad daylight. Then they attacked the Jamaat-Shibir rally and tried to kill its senior leaders. Such killings were unprecedented on the streets of Dhaka for decades. For the post-1971 generation, those killings worked as a vindication of what their parents told them about the lawlessness and ruthless murders committed by the Raksi Bahini during the BAKSAL regime after the independence of Bangladesh in 1971.\n\nThe killings of 28 October 2006 had its digitalized Awami flavor. As usual, Awami League tried to put the blame of the killings on the scapegoat Jamaat in two ways. First, they hired few local reprobate father figures who in a dispassionate and frosty fashion claimed some of the dead bodies as their own sons\u2019. When this did not work, Awami League went for the digital option. They simulated some pictures in computer and printed big posters which they pasted on the walls of Dhaka and exerted a futile exercise of scapegoating. Thus Awami League did not spare even the bereaved families whose grief was still permeated by shock and disbelief.\n\nOn 28 October 2006 I was in Dhaka, as I went to Bangladesh for spending few weeks with my family members. I met few so-called intellectuals and Dhaka University professors who claim to be the moral authority in the country and are usually loud in claiming their share in the independence of the country in 1971. Unfortunately, I did not find any of them at least regretting for what happened on the streets of Dhaka on 28 October 2006. Some other secular intellectuals who took note of it dismissed it as a usual political clash. However, had the casualties belonged to a secular party and the killers been \u2018Islamic people\u2019, the media coverage, the international ruckus and the reaction of the Islamophobe intellectuals in Dhaka would have been completely different. Who knows, it could incite another military adventure as in Afghanistan and Iraq. I believe condoning such killings as Awami League perpetrated on that day makes none of us safer. Such exercise of muscular power is contagious and may turn to anybody within or without the Awami League. I am not a member of any political party in Bangladesh. I have written this piece, as I still carry the traumatic memory of the brutalities in Dhaka on 28 October 2006. The question of justice may seem irrelevant, as Sheikh Hasina \u2013 who told her party men to bring \u2018logi-boitha\u2019 (pole-oar) \u2013 is the Prime Minister of Bangladesh now. I pity Bangladesh!\n\nAwami terrorists\u2019 armed attack on unarmed Jamaat Shibir men, 28 Oct 2006\n\nThat did not stop there. After coming to power, members of Awami League especially those of its student wing have turned the entire country into a military zone or into a gigantic concentration camp. A quick look at the Bangladeshi newspapers (from early 2009 to now) should vindicate my worry. Tortures of people belonging to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and to Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islam by Awami musclemen are taken-for-granted matters in Bangladesh now. Recently, the government has had to vacate the country\u2019s prisons to make room for opposition party people. Since Awami League uses the term \u2018secularism\u2019, the secular and powerful West tends to overlook the undemocratic practices of the current regime in Bangladesh.\n\nLet me give another example of Awami brutality that also occurred in the month of October. Unfortunately, it seems that October is a month in which we Bangladeshis need to be very careful and take extra security measures to protect ourselves from possible attacks and tragedies. Killing of the nature of 28 October 2006 took place on 08 October 2010. This time it was in Natore, not in Dhaka.\n\nOn 08 October 2010, local BNP people had brought out a procession on the eve of a party rally to be held later on that day. Equipped with \u201cfirearms, sticks, iron rods and machetes,\u201d Awami League musclemen launched an all-out attack on the procession and started beating the un-armed BNP people. Helpless in the face of their overwhelming adversaries who were armed and well-equipped (and favored by the administration), the BNP people dispersed and ran away. The upazila chairman of Boraigram, Mr Sanaullah Noor Babu did not leave the spot. Perhaps he thought the attackers would not dare to touch him because of his popularity, influence and position. He was fatally wrong. Awami League activists mercilessly beat him on the street, while the police standing nearby did not dare to prevent the ruling party thugs from assaulting Mr. Babu. The Awami hooligans also attacked journalists who tried to take pictures or to videotape the cruelty. A number of journalists were seriously injured. Mr. Babu was writhing in pain on the street for a long time and no one dared to go near him in the presence of his Awami predators. After the Awami men left the spot, people took Mr Babu to hospital and he was declared dead soon afterward. (For more details please see \u201cBoraigram upazila chairman killed\u201d, The Daily Star, Dhaka, 09 October 2010.\n\nAlthough video footage and journalists\u2019 photographs clearly identified the murderers of the upazila chairman Sanaullah Noor Babu, the police so far could not (OR DID NOT) arrest any of the prime accused. (For more details, please see \u201cKillers still at large\u201d, The Daily Star, Dhaka, 13 Oct 2010.\n\nInstead, Mr Babu\u2019s killers are threatening his wife so that she withdraws her lawsuit against them.  Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has already engaged herself in a blame game and iterates her party men\u2019s \u2018innocence\u2019. For more details, please see \u201cPM\u2019s remarks threaten justice: Delwar\u201d, The Daily Star, Dhaka, 19 October 2010. In today\u2019s Bangladesh, it is the Prime Minister\u2019s office and not the law court that passes verdict on people\u2019s innocence or guilt.  Justice seems to have disappeared from Bangladesh now.\n\n\u201cAwami League musclemen brandishing their weapons after attacking a peaceful BNP procession and beating up Boraigram Upazila Chairman Mr Sanuallah Noor Babu (writhing in pain on the ground) in Natore, Bangladesh on 08 October 2010.
