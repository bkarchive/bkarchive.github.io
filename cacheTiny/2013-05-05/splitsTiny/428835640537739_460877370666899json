One demand! Atheists must be hanged\", the activists marched down at least six main roads, AFP news agency reported.\r\n\r\nThey headed for Motijheel, the city's main commercial district.\r\n\r\nThe area around the city centre's largest mosque turned into a battleground as police reacted to stone-throwing rioters with tear gas, rubber bullets and truncheons.\r\nhttp:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-asia-22418379","picture":"https:\/\/fbcdn-photos-g-a.akamaihd.net\/hphotos-ak-ash3\/600948_460877364000233_1132201518_s.jpg"}
