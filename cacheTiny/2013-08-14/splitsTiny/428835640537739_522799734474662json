The procession, headed by the Metropolitan HRD Secretary Aiyub Ali, took place in Demra Highway of the capital.\r\n\r\nWhile addressing the post-demo gathering, Aiyub Ali said, \u201cHaving shot Shibir leader Khalilur Rahman dead during a peaceful procession on the occasion of the hartal, cops proved themselves to be some paid garrison personnel of the government. These dirty policemen strewed in the field to serve the ill purposes and blueprints of the Awami fascist government as a body supplementary to Chhatra League and Jubo League goons. We\u2019d like to warn the government that you should no longer have any acid test on Chhatrashibir. The indiscriminate killing of students by the people in legal trademark uniform shan\u2019t be tolerated any more. All has a right to self-defense. The student segment itself shall be bound to counter these criminals in disguise if the real guilty policemen are not brought to book without further delay. Then the government shall bear the liability and face accountability for whatever is likely to happen.\u201d","picture":"https:\/\/fbcdn-photos-e-a.akamaihd.net\/hphotos-ak-prn2\/1098110_522799721141330_657898638_s.jpg"}
