But they have yet to disperse the thousands of people still gathered outside the Raba'a al-Adawiya mosque in Cairo's Nasr City neighbourhood. This protest has become something of a miniature city over the past few weeks, with security guards and barricades, tents serving food, and dormitories for protesters"}
