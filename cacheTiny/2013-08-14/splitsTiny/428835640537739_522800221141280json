He invented some fantastic stories and worst types of lies and finally dared to say that Shibir men indiscriminately threw bricks and cocktails to the cops and Khalilur Rahman, the Shibir leader actually shot dead by cops, died of collision with a running car being chased by cops. What an irony of truth it is!!! But the reality is just the opposite. Policemen shot Shibir leader Khalilur Rahman to death by opening fire at the procession from behind and he also died in the very spot immediately. Eyewitnesses beheld the scene clearly and almost all media reported this killing to be a police-y killing. In such situation crystal clear, lies and propagation of DMP is nothing but another symbol of brutality which severely put honesty and courage of this department in plain question.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe said, \u201cThe police department is losing public reliance and trustworthiness due to its participation in indiscriminate killings and care-free behavior with an aim to supplement government\u2019s agenda. People are awfully scared of these law enforcement agency personnel due to their behavior suiting that of any party thugs. The police lost its esteem as it kills and denies liability like the terrorist political parties. Fie, Fie, what a shame!!! We\u2019d like to tell the policemen that you get paid out of taxpayers\u2019 money and the people don\u2019t give their money to kill their family members and relatives.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe urged DMP to expunge such false and baseless statement and bring the guilty policemen to justice.","picture":"https:\/\/fbcdn-photos-g-a.akamaihd.net\/hphotos-ak-prn1\/526448_522800207807948_1192858097_s.jpg"}
