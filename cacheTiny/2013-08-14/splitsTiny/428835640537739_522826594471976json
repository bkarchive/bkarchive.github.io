Hold the coup leaders and Ministers of the Interior and of defence in the Government of the coup d ' \u00e9tat of full responsibility. We also note that the moment the hospital broke into six floors and halls attached to the mosque crammed with the bodies of martyrs and thousands wounded since the hospital siege by security forces, preventing ambulances since the first hours of the beginning of the incursion.

In this regard I reiterate our documented cases of martyrs and injured and we will publicly shamed before the world.\r\n\r\nThe field hospital rabaa","picture":"https:\/\/fbcdn-photos-g-a.akamaihd.net\/hphotos-ak-prn2\/1150957_522826587805310_230806542_s.jpg"}
