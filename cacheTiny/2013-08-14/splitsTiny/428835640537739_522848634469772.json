They've gone to a better place. They gave their lives for the freedom of Egypt. HasbunAllah wa ni3mal wakil, have trust in Allah, have faith in Allah, and most importantly have hope in Allah!\nDifficult and testing times are passing, and it's a bitter pill to swallow. Fear can not shake us, hope in Allah can shape is as an ummah.\nDon't lose hope, give it!\nOur brothers and sisters have been chosen by Allah, the Most Merciful, to take on the honour and crown of a shaheed!\n\nRead Quran for them and make lots of dua, that's the most important thing we can do.\n\nAllah is with us\n\nZara Kadir (Fan Post)"}
