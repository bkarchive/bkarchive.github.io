Most of the mosques that were destroyed were built without government permission. Two authorised mosques in Luanda are still operating without a problem. I have not heard of any official decision to ban Islam or prohibit Muslim prayers in mosques.\u201d Ahmed ould Taher told Al Jazeera.\n\nWorldwide media coverage\n\nReports that Angola, a traditionally devout Catholic nation, would crack down on Muslims had drawn condemnation from the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and others.\n\nIn Egypt, mufti Shawqi Allam said such a move would be \"a provocation not only to Angolan Muslims but to more than 1.5 billion Muslims all over the world\".\n\nThe issue, which was first reported late last week, attracted huge media coverage worldwide and generated strong reactions on social media.\n\nThe controversy was further fueled by the government's poor communication on the issue. \n\nThe oil-rich southern African nation has a population of about 18 million people, several hundred thousand of whom are Muslims.\n\nReligious organisations are required to apply for accreditation in Angola, which currently recognises 83, all of them Christian.\n\nIn October the justice ministry rejected the applications of 194 organisations, including one from an umbrella Islamic community group.\n\nAngola's oil boom has attracted large expatriate communities from across the world.\nSource:\nAl Jazeera and agencies \nhttp:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/africa\/2013\/11\/angola-denies-reports-banning-islam-2013112782236279392.html"}
