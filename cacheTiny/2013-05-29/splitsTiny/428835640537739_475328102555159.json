She thinks all is fine and well, as if she had a family squabble with Hifazot and Jamat, and day after tomorrow everything will be forgotten. Well, who could have forgotten the terror unleashed on 28 February on Jamat Shibir and on the dark night of 6th of May. If ever anybody\u2019s hair stood on end with terror, mine must have done so then, even though thousand miles apart. No one could happily slip away, and deposit that part of conscience in the mist of history. Men\u2019s nature is to see justice, and you can bet justice shall be done. Today or tomorrow, Sheikh Hasina will have to answer for her crime.\n\n- Mozafor Ali"}
