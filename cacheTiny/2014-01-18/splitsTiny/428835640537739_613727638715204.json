The joint forces personnel have killed Shibir leaders and activists in cold blood in various districts of the country including Satkhira. Shibir activist Abu Hanif has also been killed similarly. DB policemen apprehended Choton yesterday from Poddo Shakhra of Satkhira Sadar Thana and handed over him to the joint forces. The joint forces together with him launched operations in many places throughout the whole night and shot him dead in the wee hours as per the plan preset. But now the government is propagating lies by saying that Choton died in shoot-out. Killing of such a class-8 student and subsequent false propaganda thereabout only proves government\u2019s utmost abyss.\u201d\r\n\r\nShibir Secretary-General urged the government to put an end to extra-judicial killing and bring the guilty members of the joint forces to book.","picture":"https:\/\/fbcdn-photos-c-a.akamaihd.net\/hphotos-ak-prn1\/t1\/1546450_613727465381888_1894826685_s.jpg"}
