It wants to kill top Jamaat leaders under this farcical trial as a part of the conspiracies made to uproot Islamic movement in this country. Demands for hanging of jamaat leaders were aired from another dirty platform set up in Shahbagh intersection but this mock dais failed to gain public recognition. Even the Prime Minister drew the attention of the judges to seriously take the demands of Shahbagh Gonojagoron Mancha into account and deliver the rulings thereupon. Ministers and MPs clearly cited the dates and months of hanging of Jamaat leaders while addressing the public. The Home Minister said so while he was in Egypt and verdicts of two cases were also delivered accordingly. All these things suffice to prove the fact the trial is purely directed by the government quarters and politically motivated. The whole nation of Bengal shall roar in severe anger if any unjust ruling is handed down by this farcical tribunal. The whole country will be put at closure through continuous agenda, if\nneeded. The student section shall move forward with one-point demand to oust the government.\u201d\n\nVarious units of Islami Chhatrashibir brought out processions and blocked roads and highways across the country in support of the shutdown called tomorrow in protest against handing down of verdict of Golam Azam case by the so-called tribunal."}
