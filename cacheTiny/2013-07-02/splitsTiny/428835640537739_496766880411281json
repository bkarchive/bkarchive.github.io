We, the two families, have to come here to you being confused as our heartiest sons Tazammul Ali and Azizur Rahman have been missed since June 24, 2013 afternoon.\r\nTazammul Ali is the son of Hazrat Ali of Rotnesshorpur village in Monirampur Upazilla under Jessore district, and Azizur Rahman is the son of Abdus Salam of Baher Kedar village in Bhurungamari Upazilla under Kurigram district. Tazammul Ali is a student of Master\u2019s degree under the department of Islamic studies while Azizur Rahman is waiting for his result of Master\u2019s degree final examination from the discipline of Arabic Literature under the Rajshahi University.\r\nSince June 24, 2013, they both were in Dhaka city with their friend Ismail Hossain. Different sources confirmed us that several civil personnel addressing themselves as the members of the law enforcing agencies picked up them at about 5.15 pm from in front of the People\u2019s University at Badda Shahzadpur Area in the capital city Dhaka. Different national media published the news of their abduction.\r\nBut, neither the police nor the RAB recognized the arrest of our sons. They are yet to be placed before the court after four days of their arrest, though there is a rule to place any arrestee before the court within 24 hours after arrest. Our all attempts to know their existence failed.\r\nHonourable Friends,\r\nHaving no alternative way, we have come before you to deliver our appeal to the officials of the government through you. We don\u2019t know what the offense of our children is. We will be satisfied mentally if the police place them before court on charge of any firm offense. But, we are now in uncertainty and hopeless as we don\u2019t know where our sons are.\r\nDear Journalists,\r\nCurrent situation of Bangladesh has made us anxious. We suspect that our children are being tortured cruelly in unknown place. No recognize that they both were the activists of Bangladesh Islami Chattrashibir (BICS). But, it never is an offense as BICS is an organization authorized by the constitution.\r\nDear friends,\r\nWe have gone to the police, Detective Branch (DB) of police, RAB again and again, but they have made hopeless us. They said that they have not arrested our sons. But, what kind of a state it is where two youth have been picked up in day light from a crowd of people? So, where have gone the rule of law and human rights situation?\r\nHonourable Journalists,\r\nYou have always stood to help the helpless by presenting the truth before the nation considering the social responsibilities. We adjure you, please, present the news where our sons have been kept through investigation. We are anxious like the relatives of the missing political and civil personalities in the recent days.\r\nDear Brothers,\r\nWe appeal to the Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina through you to give back our children. She must realize the pain of absence of the children as a mother. We hope, she will order the related officials to give back our sons. Our appeal also will reach to the Minister of Home Affairs. We believe they will play role without political consideration to give back our children to us.\r\nWe are grateful to you and thank you cordially as you have attend to this press conference. We pray to the Almighty Allah as you may keep rolling to serve the nation with a sound body and mind. Allah Hafez.\r\nSincerely Yours,\r\nHazrat Ali\r\n(Father of Tazammul Ali)\r\n National Press Club\r\nJune 27, 2013","picture":"https:\/\/fbcdn-photos-b-a.akamaihd.net\/hphotos-ak-prn1\/1012330_496766873744615_1338660524_s.jpg"}
