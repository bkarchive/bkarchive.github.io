This is why severe torture and persecution are being administered on Shibir men across the country. Shibir Central President has been severely oppressed following an unjust arrest and many brutal remands. Many more Shibir leaders are recently abducted by the law enforcing agency personnel. Those thus abducted are yet to be produced in the court. We\u2019d like to warn the government that oppression under the genre of abduction and murder cannot deactivate the ongoing movement of Chhatrashibir and this fact is proven again and again from time to time. Chhatashibir will, InShaAllah prove it once again by effectualizing tomorrow\u2019s nationwide dawn-to-dusk shutdown.\u201d\n\nChhatrashibir launched demos, held gatherings and blocked highways all over the country including the capital city in support of the upcoming hartal tomorrow. \n\nEspecially, Shibir Units of Dhaka Metropolitan City East, Dhaka Metropolitan City North, Dhaka Metropolitan City West, Dhaka Metropolitan City South, Jagannath University, Private University, Sylhet Metropolitan City, Chittagong Metropolitan City North, Khulna Metropolitan City, Rangpur Metropolitan City, Cox\u2019s Bazar Town, Mymensingh Town, Bogra Town, Comilla District South, Natore District, Kurigram District, Tangail Town and Patuakhali District played major roles in this regard."}
