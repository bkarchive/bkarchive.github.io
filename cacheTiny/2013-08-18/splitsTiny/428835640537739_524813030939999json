He also argued that Turkey could be next for \u201cthose who were stirring unrest\u201d in Egypt.\r\n\r\n****Egypt committing state terrorism, al-Sisi and al-Assad are same: Turkish PM\r\n\r\nTurkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has accused Egypt\u2019s interim rulers of committing state terrorism and compared army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad as scores more were killed in a crackdown and hundreds were besieged in Cairo\u2019s al-Fath Mosque by security forces.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Al-Fath Mosque is under siege. People\u2019s place of worship is innocent. They have burned, destroyed our mosques in Syria and in Egypt. Either Bashar or Sisi, there is no difference between them. There is no salvation with oppression,\u201d Erdo\u011fan said during a defiant speech in the northwestern province of Bursa Aug. 17 where he attended the launching ceremony of an urban renovation project.\r\n\r\nErdo\u011fan also slammed Egyptian officials for describing supporters of toppled President Mohamed Morsi as \u201cterrorists.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPeople are saying \u2018we ask for our vote to be honored.\u2019 But there are those calling them terrorists. But I am saying that state terrorism is currently underway in Egypt,\u201d Erdo\u011fan said.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are currently two paths in Egypt: Those who follow the Pharaoh, and those who follow Moses,\u201d he added.\r\n\r\nErdo\u011fan condemned the attacks against worship places, including churches, but said that supporters of Muslim Brotherhood where mostly protecting those places from being vandalized.\r\n\r\nHe also argued that Turkey could be next for \u201cthose who were stirring unrest\u201d in Egypt.\r\n\r\nThe tension between the countries peaked as Turkey recalled its ambassador in Cairo, sparking a reciprocal move by Egypt. Egypt\u2019s Ankara envoy, Abdurrahman Selahaddin, had urged Turkey not to side solely with the Muslim Brotherhood and respect \u201call Egyptians.\u201d\r\n\r\nHowever, Erdo\u011fan refused to step back from his defiant rhetoric vis-\u00e0-vis the July 3 military takeover, accusing those who have financially helped the \u201ccoup regime\u201d of being accomplices to its actions. He also assured that Ankara was pursuing diplomatic efforts to increase pressure on the interim government that took power following the military coup.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe had wanted the United Nations Security Council to speak with a fair and determined voice. The Organization of the Islamic Conference and the European Unionhave no face left to look at in the mirror,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\nErdo\u011fan said Turkey and Qatar had been the only supporters of the Morsi government, while also thanking the Netherlands and Denmark for their position during the current Egyptian turmoil.\r\n\r\nErdo\u011fan saluted several times the crowd with the \u2018Rabaa\u2019 sign made by raising four fingers, which has become the symbol of the killings in Egypt and at the Rabaa al-Adawiya Square where the supporters of the ousted President Mohamed Morsi have gathered for weeks.\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/islaminaustralia.com\/2013\/08\/18\/egypt-committing-state-terrorism-al-sisi-and-al-assad-are-same-turkish-pm\/\r\n\r\nTwitter: @Islam_Aust","picture":"https:\/\/fbcdn-photos-h-a.akamaihd.net\/hphotos-ak-frc1\/1001266_524813020940000_1074282190_s.jpg"}
